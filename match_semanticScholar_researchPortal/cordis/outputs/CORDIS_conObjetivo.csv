The tool would shed light on issues central to the energy transition’s success, making it precious for regulators, policymakers, energy-intensive consumers, and energy firms. In particular, the tool would be instrumental in informing the current policy debate on the electricity market reform. The tool would build on state-of-the-art game-theoretical models developed by the PI through her ERC Consolidator Grant ELECTRIC CHALLENGES, providing the basis to simulate firms’ competitive and strategic behavior in electricity markets with large shares of renewable energies and energy storage. Those models also serve to assess the low-carbon investments’ impact on several metrics reflecting electricity market outcomes (prices, market shares, emissions, etc.) and firms’ financial profitability (pay-back period, NPV, IRR, etc.) The algorithm would be programmed in Python, and an internet-based interface would be developed for ease of use. Data from the Spanish electricity market would be used to test the tool, which would be further extended to other European power markets. Relevant stakeholders in the sector have already shown their support and willingness to participate in the training and testing stages. The team comprises the PI (Natalia Fabra), postdocs at EnergyEcoLab (the research lab she created under her ERC grant), and software programmers who would carry out the programming activities. The team combines a deep knowledge of the power sector and the energy transition policies, a deep understanding of the relevant economic questions, and a deep command of the methods for modeling and quantifying the performance of electricity markets.",101123298
act540051,MACROHIST - Macroeconomics and Financial History,2013.0,2017.0,EUROPEAN COMMISSION RESEARCH EXECUTIVE AGENCY,PITN-GA-2013-608129,European Research Project,,"The current macroeconomic and financial crisis has given rise to a vigorous debate about the state of macroeconomics and macroeconomic training. Among the voices arguing most strongly for a change in the way that young macroeconomists are trained are those coming from employers in the private and public sector. Strikingly, many employers are also arguing that a knowledge of economic history might be particularly useful.  A knowledge of economic and financial history is crucial in thinking about macroeconomic problems and the financial sector in several ways. It forces students to recognize that major discontinuities in economic performance and economic policy regimes have occurred many times in the past, and may therefore occur again in the future. Additionally, economic history teaches students the importance of context. Finally, exposure to economic history leads to an empirical frame of mind, and a willingness to admit that one’s preferred theoretical framework may not always work in explaining the real world. These are essential habits for young economists wishing to apply their skills in the work environment. Young macroeconomists need training in economic and financial history. Equally, students of economic history need exposure to the techniques of modern macroeconomics and financial economics. MACROHIST brings together some of the strongest history, economic history and economics departments in Europe. Its aim is to expose young macroeconomists to the most recent work in macroeconomic and financial history; young economic historians to the most recent techniques in financial and macroeconomics, and both groups to the policy and work environment. We will achieve these aims by funding research on macroeconomics and macroeconomic and financial history; by funding visiting studentships for ESRs in partner institutions; by organising internships and other activities with our private sector partners; and by arranging network-wide research and training events.",608129

Indeed, under some specific circumstances, aircraft can generate anthropogenic cirrus with cooling. Thus, the need for research into contrails and aviation-induced cloudiness and its associated uncertainties to be considered in aviation climate mitigation actions becomes unquestionable.We will blend cutting-edge AI techniques (deep learning) and climate science with application to the aviation domain, aiming at closing (at least partially) de existing gap in terms of understanding aviation-induced climate impact. The overall purpose of E-CONTRAIL project is to develop artificial neural networks (leveraging remote sensing detection methods) for the prediction of the climate impact derived from contrails and aviation-induced cloudiness, contributing, thus, to a better understanding of the non-CO2 impact of aviation on global warming and reducing their associated uncertainties as essential steps towards green aviation. Specifically, the objectives of E-CONTRAIL are:O-1 to develop remote sensing algorithms for the detection of contrails and aviation-induced cloudiness.O-2 to quantify the radiative forcing of ice clouds based on remote sensing and radiative transfer methods.O-3 to use of deep learning architectures to generate AI models capable of predicting the radiative forcing of contrails based on data-archive numerical weather forecasts and historical trafficO-4 to assess the climate impact and develop a visualization tool in a dashboardUpon successful achievement of the objectives described above, we ambition to provide aviation stakeholders with an early and accurate (thus, reducing the associated uncertainty) prediction of those volumes of airspace with the conditions for large global warming impact due to contrails and aviation-induced cloudiness.",101114795

Although new agents are emerging, the path to registration of such regimens remains uncertain while capacity for pivotal trials is limited. Selection and optimization of drug combinations for development depends on preclinical systems which do not capture in vivo pharmacodynamics of heterogeneous states of M.tuberculosis.These systems are diverse and their predictive power for clinical trial outcomes is uncertain, escalating risks during development. To overcome these bottlenecks, PreDiCT-TB will take a comprehensive model based approach, synthesizing and integrating preclinical and clinical information. We will harness innovative technologies to develop an integrated set of predictive pre-clinical tools to facilitate selection of the best drug combinations and dosages for entry into optimized clinical studies. We will develop diverse existing and innovative experimental models of pharmacodynamics from extracellular MTB organisms, through to acute and chronic animal models in different species. We will enhance these systems using innovative single cell and functional imaging, novel mycobacteriological approaches and identification of biomarkers of lethality and sterilization. We will represent these critical data using multi-scale mathematical approaches incorporating PK-PD and disease models, supported by a translational data integration platform.The aim is an optimized decision pathway for combination regimens to progress to innovative early clinical trials. We will develop this modelling framework using a training set of reference compounds and subsequently update it with emerging data from new compounds. We believe that this comprehensive approach is the only way to overcome existing gaps in translation and create an effective and rapid drug development strategy for European researchers.",115337

Unfortunately, this change has deep consequences for users, who, deprived of any negotiation power, are compelled to blindly provide their data for free access to services. Data collection is opaque, fragmented and disharmonic, so that users have no control over their personal data, and, thus, on their privacy. Personal Information Management Systems (PIMS) aim to give users back control over their data, while creating transparency in the market. However, so far, they have failed to reach business maturity and sizeable user bases.PIMCity offers tools to change this scenario. First, we implement a PIMS development kit (PDK) to commoditize the complexity of creating PIMS. This lowers the barriers for companies and SME to enter the web data market. Second, we design and deploy novel mechanisms to increase users' awareness: (i) the Transparency Tags (TT) show users essential information about the services they access, in a simple and easy to understand manner; (ii) the Personal Data Avatar (PDA) is an intuitive means for users to control the information shared to third parties. Third, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the above tools by engineering EasyPIMS, our fully-fledged PIMS. We commit to build the largest-ever transparent data marketplace implementing and demonstrating EasyPIMS with hundreds of thousands of end-users, collaborating with advertisers and operators in the web market.We strongly believe that an open market for data will only flourish if we stop the arms race between users and services. For this, we involve advertisers and end-users in the whole process. PIMCity has all these players in our consortium, along with leading IT companies and data providers, renowned research centres and universities, and SMEs already in the market of PIMS.",871370

The concept uses  independently steerable wireless pencil-beams with fiber data throughput capacity, allowing mobile site connectivity scenarios in dense urban areas with macro/street level densification, temporal mobile site connectivity in ad-hoc networks, and connectivity to moving objects in public or private networks.Hybrid photonic integration is the key enabler technology to develop a Blass-Matrix Transmitter and an incoherent-multi-band Receiver with key disruptive characteristics, including agility (handling any modulation scheme and continuous tuning of the carrier frequency across the target spectrum range), scalability (handling large number of beams with 2-dimensional antenna arrays for beamformed antenna gain >25 dBi and > 100º steering angles beam-steering) and reconfigurability (performing a variety of functions, from wireless data transmission, or radar ranging to channel sounding).These disruptive wireless transceiver modules characteristics will be exploited at network level by developing the dynamic allocation of the network resources that these bring. We plan to dynamically analyze the position of the different wireless nodes and the channel resources using respectively the radar ranging and channel sounding techniques enabled by the novel reconfigurable TERA6G photonic transceivers. This will allow for novel scheduling methods capable of alternating paths to establish the connectivity, ensuring connection reliability, and considering energy consumption in the establishment of the wireless link.

The latter infrastructure is ageing urgently requiring inspection and assessment. Presently, inspection is mostly performed through tunnel wide visual observations by inspectors. This process is slow, labour intensive, expensive, subjective and often requiring lane shutdown during inspection at a time of limited budgets and inspector resources and heightened requirements for safety and maximum tunnel uptime. ROBINSPECT, driven by the tunnel inspection industry, adapts and integrates recent research results in intelligent control in robotics, computer vision tailored with semi-supervised  and active continuous learning and sensing, in an innovative, integrated, robotic system that automatically scans the intrados for potential defects on the surface and detects and measures radial deformation in the cross-section, distance between parallel cracks, cracks and open joints that impact tunnel stability, with mm accuracies. This permits, in one pass, both the inspection and structural assessment of tunnels. Intelligent control and robotics tools are interwoven to set an automatic robotic arm manipulation and an autonomous vehicle navigation so as to minimize humans' interaction. This way, the structural condition and safety of a tunnel is assessed automatically, reliably and speedily. The initial dataset on tunnel defects is provided from case studies (e.g., from London Underground) to be used not only for transfer learning but also for the evaluation of the structural models. The robotic system is evaluated and benchmarked at the research infrastructure of tunnels of VSH, at three road tunnels of the Egnatia Motorway and sections of the railway tunnel of London Post Office.",611145

Thus, ITER success remains the most important overarching objective of the programme and, in the present proposal the vast majority of resources in Horizon 2020 are devoted to ensure that ITER is built within scope, time and budget; its operation is properly prepared; and a new generation of scientists and engineers is properly educated (at undergraduate and PhD level) and trained (at postdoctoral level) for its exploitation. DEMO is the only step between ITER and a commercial fusion power plant. To achieve the goal of fusion electricity demonstration by 2050, DEMO construction has to begin in the early 2030s at the latest, to allow the start of operation in the early 2040s.

E.T.PACK aims at developing a proof of concept for LWTs by breaking through and combining the current frontier of knowledge in three fields: plasma physics, low work function material science and space tethers. These will be integrated into a deorbit kit and a flight simulator for mission analysis. The kit aims to reach Technology Readiness Level 4 and will have two modes of operation: as a fully passive LWT and as a conventional electrodynamic tether equipped with an active hollow-cathode (backup mode). A new coating process for the electride, C12A7 ([Ca24Al28O64]4+(4e-)), will be developed, and used to manufacture a LWT demonstrator.

The most promising scenarios envisage the introduction of a new class of service platforms characterized by versatility and a high level of reusability, the so-called Space Tug. Other applications, nowadays of particular interest, are the active debris removal to mitigate the possible collision risks. Besides, several exploration and scientific missions, such as Mars Sample Return, contemplate high power electric propulsion as the main propulsion system.Despite these potential advantages, several factors have limited the possibility of reaching qualified status for these systems, such as huge costs and availability of test facility. ASPIRE aims to increase the TRL of 20kW Hall Thruster system up to 6 by exploiting results obtained within CHEOPS. The project will cover many aspects, from mission scenarios analysis and satellite architecture consolidation to thruster unit TRL raise to 7 and enabling reduced-cost qualification.

The central strategy was based on policies to encourage investment in knowledge. Knowledge as a public good with potential spillovers is the rationale behind intellectual property protection and subsidies for investments in innovations that will potentially lead to high spillovers. University research that creates basic knowledge is a leading example of this. But research shows that spillovers are also generated from private firms’ R&D and that firms can therefore benefit from the presence of more innovative and more productive firms. But which universities and which firms are more innovative? And how does globalization influence the answer to these questions? Finally, how can policy influence the innovation process? This project aims at answering these questions, without forgetting their implications in terms of income inequality and volatility, which impacts on the political sustainability of the innovation dynamics.To do this, the first part of the project will focus more specifically on the knowledge sector itself. This second part of the project will look at the ‘bigger picture’, looking at the overall organization of firms in the global knowledge economy, as well as its implications on markets and inequality. The third part will contain a summary and policy recommendations: while the project brings together researchers at the frontier of academic knowledge on these topics, its outcomes will be highly policy-relevant.

There, one keystone for robots to carry out accurate and intelligent tasks, with and for people, is their ability both to handle autonomously all sorts of objects and to use human tools. However, today's robots are unable to achieve dexterous and fine manipulation, especially when this requires in-hand manipulation. They are far from being able to understand and reason about their environments, their goals and their own capabilities, to learn skills and improve their performance by what they have been taught and their own experience, to interact with their environments with the efficiency of humans.The HANDLE project aims at understanding how humans perform the manipulation of objects in order to replicate grasping and skilled in-hand movements with an anthropomorphic artificial hand, and thereby move robot grippers from current best practice towards more autonomous, natural and effective articulated hands. The project implies not only focusing on technological developments but also working with fundamental multidisciplinary research aspects in order to endow the robotic hand system with advanced perception capabilities, high level feedback control and elements of intelligence that allow recognition of objects and context, reasoning about actions and a high degree of recovery from failure during the execution of dexterous tasks.Integrating findings from disciplines such as neuroscience, developmental psychology, cognitive science, robotics, multimodal perception and machine learning, the method we will develop is based on an original blend of learning and predicting behaviours from imitation and ""babbling"" to allow the robot to be capable of responding to gaps in its knowledge.",231640

Climate optimization will take into account CO2 and non-CO2 effects, such as contrails and contrail-cirrus, water vapour, NOx and particulate emissions. FlyATM4E will identify those weather situations and aircraft trajectories, which lead to a robust climate impact reduction despite uncertainties in atmospheric science that can be characterised by ensemble probabilistic forecasts. This will improve the assessment of aviation’s climate impact. It will further identify those situations where there is a large potential to reduce the climate impact with only little or even no cost changes (“Cherry-Picking”) and those situations where both, climate impact and costs can be reduced (“Win-Win”).

Moreover, the global crisis of antimicrobial resistance means that HAI is posing an increasing cost and risk of mortality. There is clear evidence that airflow controls the dispersion and exposure to airborne pathogens and determines the contamination of critical surfaces in the human-centric climate (HCC), which is defined as the microenvironment which surrounds and is close to a human body. This points to a significant need for innovation in healthcare indoor environments to tackle the challenge of infectioncontrol, while improving thermal comfort and energy efficiency in hospitals. To achieve this, we must both advance the fundamental understanding of how people are exposed to airborne pathogens and develop new tools and techniques to enable effective design and operation of healthcare environments. Specifically, there is a need to understand better the local influence of airflows on particles in HCC; quantify the transient behaviour of airflows and contaminants due to healthcare activities like surgery; develop methods for optimising and adapting ventilation systems to control for risks in different environments like operation rooms and isolation rooms; and develop tools to enable real-time interaction with environments during design and operational phases. Bringing together 8 leading academic teams, 4 healthcare facilities and 8 HVAC industry partners, the HumanIC network aims to build a new approach to hospital environmental design through the concept of HCC and the training of 15 Early Career Stage Researchers to address these needs.

Thanks to recent developments at the frontiers of phononic metamaterials it can be identified that active phononic control is at the cutting edge of the current research on phononic metamaterials. Introducing piezoelectric semiconductors as a material platform to discover new avenues in wave physics will have the potential to open horizons of opportunities in science of acoustic wave control. Electrically biased piezoelectric semiconductors are non-reciprocal by nature, produce mechanical gain and are highly tunable. The aim is to explore novel properties of sound and the ability to design Parity-Time (PT) symmetric systems that define a consistent unitary extension of quantum mechanics. Through cunningly contrived piezoelectric media sculpturing balanced loss and gain units, these structures have neither parity symmetry nor time-reversal symmetry, but are nevertheless symmetric in the product of both. PHONOMETA is inspired and driven by these common notions of quantum mechanics that I wish to translate into classical acoustics with unprecedented knowledge for the case of sound. I expect that the successful realization of PHONOMETA has the potential to revolutionize acoustics in our daily life. Environmental and ambient noise stem from multiple scattering and reflections of sound in our surrounding. The extraordinary properties of PT acoustic metamaterials have the groundbreaking potential to push forward physical acoustics with new paradigms to design tunable diode-like behaviour with zero reflections, which is applicable for noise pollution mitigation. Also I anticipate to impact the progress on invisibility cloaks by introducing PT symmetry based acoustic stealth coatings for hiding submarines.",714577

The project builds on state-of the-art knowledge that only recently became available in different European states as represented by the partners herein. In return it delivers the first such hybrid system worldwide.  The system will operate by 1) co-registering XCT images with highly performing FMT images for merging anatomical, functional and molecular contrast and by 2) combining XCT information into the FMT inversion to provide a system with superior imaging performance. XCT-based correction, as explained in this proposal, can improve FMT performance in a more radical way than corresponding “correction methods” used for improving PET or SPECT images. In this way FMT-XCT can reach the imaging accuracy of radio-nuclei-based tomography hybrid systems. By using fluorescence, FMT-XCT can then enable high flexibility in targeting physiology and molecular function, especially in multi-spectral mode, and high dissemination potential because virtually any biomedical laboratory has access to fluorescence reporting, compared to radio-nuclei based research that requires access to radiochemistry and cyclotron facilities.  FMT-XCT aims in advancing small animal imaging and drug discovery with a view towards the clinical application on non-invasive breast cancer imaging. For this reason, focus herein is given to imaging breast cancer and response to therapy. Overall the technology is ideally suited for commercial translation and has the potential to become the method of choice for in-vivo imaging in most biomedical laboratories and in select clinical applications.

This has been due to weaknesses inherent in the current sequential programming model, which has not changed significantly since the late 1940's, as well as due to physical constraints, such as practical limits on the energy consumption and the associated cooling efforts for a processor. To keep satisfying the ever-growing demand for computing power, these difficulties have forced a shift from homogeneous machines relying on a one single kind of fast processing element (the CPU) such as typical PCs some years ago, programmed mostly sequentially, to heterogeneous architectures combining different kinds of processors (such as CPUs, GPUs and DSPs) each specialized for certain tasks, and programmed in a highly parallel fashion yet poorly optimising the available resources towards performance and low energy consumption.The REPARA project joins forces of experts in software engineering methodology, development tools, computer hardware design and analysis, all working hand-in-hand with industrial end-users to achieve a unified programming model for heterogeneous computers developing also the required automated software support tools. Relative to the base line of a sequential algorithm executed on a current general-purpose processor, REPARA expects to achieve at least a 50% reduction of energy consumption combined with a performance improvement of at least by a factor of two. REPARA will also allow for an increased productivity realizing designs in half of the development time that would be required using non-unified programming methods for the different components of a heterogeneous system. Combined, REPARA will lead to fourfold gain in efficiency for energy savings and performance. These objectives will be verified in 5 real-world use cases in the domains of railway, healthcare and industrial maintenance and robotics.Achieving such ambitious objectives will create opportunities for the involved contractors and the European citizens on various strands. The industrial contractors EVOPRO and IXION are active in the targeted use cases and will earn improved competitiveness over other players in their respective markets turning the REPARA results into higher profits and increased employment. The 5 academic contractors will not only strengthen their scientific reputation as leading experts in the field, but their tools will facilitate them to also commercially exploit their research efforts through tool licensing and industry-academia follow-on projects.

The consortium gathers expertise from different backgrounds (legal, economic, engineering), belonging to EU countries, as well as Israel and China. Complementary research perspectives, innovative training and international/intersectoral cooperation will boost staff careers development by studying how the use of digital technologies can shape a trustworthy European environment, in which citizens are empowered in how they act and interact, and promote economic growth as well.",101007820

Therefore, the sustainability of our planet depends critically on a smart and energy-efficient operation of cities. Wireless communication technologies arise as one of the main enablers to reach this goal. For example, services and applications such as intelligent transportation, industry automation, and mobile healthcare will require to accommodate a vast number of heterogeneous and battery-limited wireless devices connecting asynchronously and sporadically to the network. This is commonly known as the massive connectivity problem. Since traditional wireless communication technologies were not designed to support this kind of services and applications, there is a need for a profound theoretical study of this problem.The main objective of MASCOT is to characterize, from an information-theoretic perspective, the fundamental limits and tradeoffs of the asynchronous massive connectivity problem. To this end, I will derive in the outgoing phase at MIT nonasymptotic bounds and asymptotic expansions characterizing these limits. In the return phase at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, I will then explore different strategies to efficiently and accurately compute the nonasymptotic bounds derived at MIT. During the course of the project, I will elaborate guidelines about how future wireless communication schemes must be designed, and I will adapt existing schemes according to these guidelines. The proposed training activities during the fellowship are fundamental for the correct achievements of MASCOT as well as to secure my future career goals. MASCOT guarantees a two-way transfer of knowledge since it combines my past expertise on elaborating and efficiently evaluating fundamental limits of low-latency wireless communications with the supervisors’ expertise on information theory applied to the massive connectivity problem and asynchronous communications.",101024432

Biometric solutions have also seen increased prominence over the past decade with large-scale implementations in areas such as passport and national ID systems. The adoption of specific biometric sensors by mobile vendors indicates a long-term strategy as a means of authentication.

I aim to apply heterogeneous 3D printed MAPs as modifiable substrates to support biological structures which can have their deformation state and stiffness controlled by the external application of magnetic stimuli. Such mechanical stimulation has an important role on biological structures leading to alterations in functional responses, morphological changes and activation of growth or healing processes. Current bottlenecks preventing progress in this field are a lack of: a) appropriate experimental methodologies to enable characterisation of the behaviour of these materials; b) fundamental theoretical underpinnings to support the design and application of these new materials. The first step is to undertake in depth characterisation and assessment of 4D printed MAPs to create a detailed understanding of the underlying physics controlling the interactions between the polymeric matrices and embedded magnetic particles during application of mechanical and/or magnetic loadings. I will then culture biological structures on the novel 4D printed MAPs to create a ‘designed’ biostructure with specified and controllable responses to a given magnetic stimulus. These novel biostructures will be assessed using three applications: a) astrocyte cellular networks, b) neuronal circuits and c) astrocyte-neuronal networks.

This project is devised to challenge this idea and establish a new framework which incorporates a deterministic component within the fragmentation mechanisms. In order to check the correctness of this new theory, I will develop a comprehensive experimental, analytical and numerical methodology to address 4 canonical fragmentation problems which respond to distinct geometric and loading conditions which make easily identifiable from a mechanical standpoint. For each canonical problem, I will investigate traditionally-machined and 3D-printed specimens manufactured with 4 different engineering metals widely used in aerospace and civilian-security applications. The goal is to elucidate whether at sufficiently high strain rates there may be a transition in the fragmentation mechanisms from defects–controlled to inertia–controlled. If the new statistical-deterministic framework is proven to be valid, defects may not play the major role in the fragmentation at high strain rates. This would bring down the entry barriers that the 3D-printing technology has found in energy absorption applications, thus reducing production transportation and repairing, energetic and economic costs of protective structures without impairing their energy absorption capacity.It is anticipated that leading this cutting-edge research project will enable me to establish my own research team and help me to achieve career independence in the field of dynamic behaviour of ductile solids.",758056

The central strategy was based on policies to encourage investment in knowledge. Knowledge as a public good with potential spillovers is the rationale behind intellectual property protection and subsidies for investments in innovations that will potentially lead to high spillovers. University research that creates basic knowledge is a leading example of this. But research shows that spillovers are also generated from private firms’ R&D and that firms can therefore benefit from the presence of more innovative and more productive firms. But which universities and which firms are more innovative? And how does globalization influence the answer to these questions? Finally, how can policy influence the innovation process? This project aims at answering these questions, without forgetting their implications in terms of income inequality and volatility, which impacts on the political sustainability of the innovation dynamics.To do this, the first part of the project will focus more specifically on the knowledge sector itself. This second part of the project will look at the ‘bigger picture’, looking at the overall organization of firms in the global knowledge economy, as well as its implications on markets and inequality. The third part will contain a summary and policy recommendations: while the project brings together researchers at the frontier of academic knowledge on these topics, its outcomes will be highly policy-relevant.

However, today's wireless networks are unable to rapidly adapt to evolving contexts and service needs due to their rigid architectural design.We believe that the wireless Internet's inability to keep up with innovation directly stems from its reliance on the traditional layer-based Internet abstraction. Especially, the Link Layer interface appears way too abstracted from the actual wireless access and coordination needs. FLAVIA fosters a paradigm shift towards the Future Wireless Internet: from pre-designed link services to programmable link processors. The key concept is to expose flexible programmable interfaces enabling service customization and performance optimization through software-based exploitation of low-level operations and control primitives, e.g., transmission timing, frame customization and processing, spectrum and channel management, power control, etc.FLAVIA's approach is based on three main pillars: i) lower the interface between hardware-dependent layers and upper layers, ii) apply a hierarchical decomposition of the MAC/PHY layer functionalities, and iii) open programmable interfaces at different abstraction levels. To prove the viability of this new architectural vision, FLAVIA will prototype its concept on two wireless technologies currently available, 802.11 and 802.16, representing today's two main radio resource allocation philosophies: contention-based and scheduled. Moreover, FLAVIA will assess the applicability of the proposed architecture concepts to the emerging 3GPP standards.FLAVIA's concept will allow boosting innovation and reducing the cost of network upgrades.

The current solution for such systems requires an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) prior to the signal processing block, usually implemented with a neural network (NN). The innovation consists of removing the ADC prior to the NN by directly coupling the sensor to it and encoding the sensor signals with a voltage-controlled-oscillator (VCO). VCO-based ADCs have been used to implement integrated sensors. Achieving this goal requires to develop a new multiply-accumulate cell (MAC) for the first layer of the NN that operates with signals from the VCO, and a suitable VCO interfaces with existing sensors.  In most applications, the raw data form the sensor is required as well. Here, signals coming from the VCO can also be converted to a sampled sequence by enabling a digital decoder, which is not needed when detecting a pattern in the NN. As a benefit, power consumption can meet the requirements of battery-operated products. Power improvement comes from both the ADC removal and the power efficiency of the NN implementation. Approaches to implement a sensor interface using a VCO and to implement a phase/frequency-encoded MAC unit (P-MAC) for a NN have been attempted separately but, there is no combination of both ideas. The research in this EID tries to bridge this gap. This architecture can be useful for both research and industrial applications, such as neural probe chips, wearable electronics or battery powered IoT devices. This EID proposal requires intersectoral involvement of both academia and the industry, to develop a doctoral program and train researchers that will be in high demand by having the specific skills developed in this research.

Researchers decide what to research, with whom to collaborate, and how much to invest into discovery. While researchers enjoy institutionalized or implicit scientific freedom, two categories govern the researcher's decision which question to address and how much effort to exert: (i) prior knowledge and (ii) the market for ideas.Prior knowledge is vital to determine how knowledge evolves. Researchers stand on the shoulders of giants and use conjectures derived from previous discoveries when they address problems.  They assess their ex ante prospects on finding an answer by looking at related findings. However, researchers also operate in the market for ideas. Careers depend on how marketable an idea is, how well researchers exploit synergies and complementarities with collaborators, what topics range high on the policy agenda, and what funding opportunities the researcher can access. In sum, how much effort the researcher invests depends crucially on the market for ideas.Our work combines these two aspects and proposes a flexible model to predict the researcher's choice and determine the evolution of knowledge over time. The model is set up with the data in mind to be able to derive meaningful counterfactuals. We can derive implications for designing the market for ideas, e.g., through adapting the funding architecture. We address questions such as: When should funding focus on cost reductions (e.g., grants), when on rewards (e.g., prizes)? When should we push for """"moonshot discoveries"""" when for incremental research?

Thus, ITER success remains the most important overarching objective of the programme and, in the present proposal the vast majority of resources in Horizon 2020 are devoted to ensure that ITER is built within scope, time and budget; its operation is properly prepared; and a new generation of scientists and engineers is properly educated (at undergraduate and PhD level) and trained (at postdoctoral level) for its exploitation. DEMO is the only step between ITER and a commercial fusion power plant. To achieve the goal of fusion electricity demonstration by 2050, DEMO construction has to begin in the early 2030s at the latest, to allow the start of operation in the early 2040s. DEMO cannot be defined and designed by research laboratories alone, but requires the full involvement of industry in all technological and systems aspects of the design. Specific provisions for the involvement of industry in the Consortium activities are envisaged.",633053

In order to improve the current epoxy based composites behavior under thermal affection, an alternative is going be addressed: thermoplastic composites.Additionally, the sector is making a transition to a more electric aircraft, increasing the thermal affection on the structure since the number of heat & fire sources.Hence, there are several reasons behind the drastic shift from aluminum and steel to thermoplastics: weight reduction, better fuel economy and lower operation costs, emissions reduction, corrosion and fatigue resistance or, in some cases, flame resistance and retardancy . The framework of this topic is AIRFRAME ITD Work Package B-2.1 and B-2.2 whose objective is to achieve lighter and more cost effective structures. In this line, current tendency at A/C level is to increase the structural contribution of the more efficient composites substituting metallic structures, developing fuselages with optimized usage of volume and minimized weight, cost and environmental impact.Under this framework, the research project HITCOMP aims to characterize the behaviour, under fire and thermal affection, of new high performance  thermoplastic composites based on PAEK family resins, for comparison to the current thermoset, epoxy based, composites. HITCOMP aims as well to establish an innovative methodology allowing an affordable characterization of thermoplastics and the prediction of their behaviour and resistence when submitted to fire or high temperature events and to mechanical load. For this purpose, a thermo-mechanical model based on FEM permitting an innovative “virtual” characterization of specimens will be developed. An innovative testing lab based on two co-registrated IR cameras will be developed too. It will allow accurate, non-intrusive measurements of the actual temperature of both sides of the samples during the fire tests and for the adjustment and validation of the model.",864713

A complementary objective is to provide an adequate framework for the discussion of migration policies.There are three issues related to migration flows that are important from a practical point of view and are the object of this research project: The effects of migrants on the cost of providing public goods, the effects of migrants on welfare of local labour force, and the effects of migrants on housing markets. The project aims to build general enough models to analyze the welfare consequences of free mobility of persons within countries when there are public goods that can be congested, to design policies to regulate international migration, and to propose realistic policies to compensate deserving losers from migration flows (some of them based on housing markets).More specifically, the project plans to construct a model with local public goods and congestion levels endogenously determined and, for such a model, define and explore the welfare characteristics of the competitive equilibrium for different forms of financing public goods and find conditions for obtaining gains from migration. On the other hand, the project wants to analyze non linear second best redistributive policies that make Pareto gains from migration attainable. Finally, the project aims to introduce explicitly housing markets in a General Equilibrium model and analyze how housing price equilibrium vary when migration is freed, and how tax policies based on housing market  prices can act a regulatory migration device and as a compensation device of possible losers with migration.",268238

To enable climate-neutral flight, aircraft for short and medium-range distances have to rely on ultra-efficient thermal energy-based propulsion technologies using sustainable drop-in and non-drop-in fuels. Besides propulsion, the integration aspects of the fuel tanks and distribution system as well as sustainable materials for the fuselage, empennage are essential to meet an overarching climate-neutrality of the aviation sector. Green propulsion and fuel technologies will have a major impact on the full fuselage, including the rear fuselage, the empennage structure as well as cabin and cargo architecture in so far as the integration of storage and the integration of systems for the chosen energy source are concerned (H2, direct burn, fuel cell). Not only do the specific properties of hydrogen necessitate a re-consideration of typical aircraft configurations, requiring new design principles formulation and fundamental validation exercises, but they also raise a large number of important follow-on questions relating to hydrogen distribution under realistic operational constraints and safety aspects. The project will explore and exploit advanced production technologies for the integrated fuselage / empennage to reduce production waste and increase material and energy exploitation with Integrated Fuselage concept selected (maturity TRL3/4) until end of first phase in 2025.

This interdisciplinary and intersectoral project explores the gender bias within the Spanish telecommunications industry as a direct consequence of the lack of women in the sector. The purpose is to develop a multi-methodological study that allows to draw attention and evidence the gender gap and the consequent lack of a gender perspective within this industry in Spain. The central hypothesis is that the current gender gap in the sector leads to lack of integration of a gender perspective leading consequently, to the reproduction of gender bias in AI technologies. This, as a result, produces a setback in gender equality. To explore this, the study asks the following questions: what is the degree of the gender gap within the telecommunications industry in Spain? Are measures being taken to address this? To answer these questions, I will gather data on two levels: first, at the general level by implementing a quantitative survey-based methodology, targeting 400 industry insiders to gain information on the gender gap in the overall sector; and second, at the specific level, by carrying out a case-study through my secondment at Telefónica, Investigación y Desarrollo (TID), a Spanish leading research centre in new technologies where I will use qualitative-based methodologies to investigate its gender bias and its lack of integration of a gender perspective. A major outcome of this research is the production of a report to be handed to TID with specific guidelines for the incorporation of a gender perspective that will help them reduce their gender bias in their AI technologies and improve the commercialisation of their products. This report will have the potentiality of becoming a benchmark study for further research in the field, particularly within the European context.",101028792

It shall possess multi-functionality that will comprise thermal barrier effect, oxidation and corrosion protection, lotus effect, electrical insulation at elevated temperatures and fire protection.   The concept of the novel approach to protection of surfaces is a coating consisting in its initial state of nano- and/or micro-scaled metal particles with a defined size, deposited by spraying, brushing, dipping or sol-gel. During the heat treatment, the binder is expelled, bonding to the substrate surface achieved, the metallic particles sinter and oxidise completely resulting in hollow oxide spheres that form a quasi-foam structure. Simultaneously, a diffusion layer is formed below the coating serving as a corrosion protection layer and as a bond coat for the top layer. The structure of the coating system shall be adjusted by parameters like selection of source metal/alloy, particle size, substrate, binder and a defined heat treatment. For fire protection the formation of hollow oxide spheres will be processed in a separate step before deposition.  The flexibility of the new coatings integrates a wide field of application areas, such as gas and steam turbines in electric power generation and aero-engines, combustion chambers, boilers, steam generators and super-heaters, waste incineration, fire protection of composite materials in construction as well as reactors in chemical and petrochemical industry. A broad impact will thus be ensured increasing safety and the durability of components by an economic, multifunctional and flexible protection of their surfaces.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are commonly regarded as the cornerstone for NI design; indeed, AI models have proven extremely successful at solving hard problems that require inferring complex relationships from entangled and massive (e.g., traffic) data. However, AI is not the best solution for every NI task; and, when it is, the dominating trend of plugging ‘vanilla’ AI into network controllers and orchestrators is not a sensible choice.Departing from the current hype around AI, DAEMON will set forth a pragmatic approach to NI design. The project will carry out a systematic analysis of which NI tasks are appropriately solved with AI models, providing a solid set of guidelines for the use of machine learning in network functions. For those problems where AI is a suitable tool, DAEMON will design tailored AI models that respond to the specific needs of network functions, taking advantage of the most recent advances in machine learning. Building on these models, DAEMON will design an end-to-end NI-native architecture for B5G that fully coordinates NI-assisted functionalities.The advances to NI devised by DAEMON will be applied in practical network settings to: (i) deliver extremely high performance while making an efficient use of the underlying radio and computational resources; (ii) reduce the energy footprint of mobile networks; and (iii) provide extremely high reliability beyond that of 5G systems. To achieve this, DAEMON will design practical algorithms for eight concrete NI-assisted functionalities, carefully selected to achieve the objectives above. The performance of the DAEMON algorithms will be evaluated in real-world conditions via four experimental sites, and at scale with data-driven approaches based on two nationwide traffic measurement datasets, against nine ambitious yet feasible KPI targets.",101017109

Structural elements used in these sectors are frequently subjected to a large variety of unusually severe thermo-mechanical solicitations. One easily realizes that this type of structures (e.g. components for satellites) has to be designed to sustain extreme temperatures, which may vary hundred degrees in short periods of time, and extreme mechanical loadings like hypervelocity impacts. New specific structural solutions are constantly developed to fulfill such requirements, which place these industrial sectors in the forefront of the technological innovation. Hereby, aerospace and defense industries constitute the natural meeting point between academia and entrepreneurial fabric. A deep understanding of the response of structures under the aforementioned sharp solicitations is mandatory for design purposes. Unfortunately, not even today is easy to find researchers in the labour market with such specific (and complicated) understanding. Aerospace and defence industries require highly-qualified technical staff capable of developing research and innovation within the framework of structural mechanics. This is the precise context where our proposal lies. We intend to form a consortium composed of 3 academic beneficiaries and 2 industrial beneficiaries which aims at developing specific training for early-stage researchers within the field of aerospace and defense structures subjected to severe thermo-mechanical loads.

The second line of research consists in an attempt to single out what is the relevant industry level of aggregation in analysing the macroeconomic effects of trade liberalization with heterogeneous firms. A theoretical framework suitable to analyse the aggregate trade and growth effects of cross-country specialization across industries aggregated according to new criteria will be provided, and its implication will be empirically assessed.

Exploring this big health data promises to reveal new insights into disease mechanisms and therapy outcomes. Ultimately, the goal is to exploit these insights for Precision Medicine, which hopes to offer personalized preventive care and therapy selection for each patient. A technology with transformational potential in analysing this health data is Machine Learning. Machine Learning strives to discover new knowledge in form of statistical dependencies in large datasets. Mining health data is, however, not a simple direct application of established machine learning techniques. On the contrary, the emerging population-scale and ultra-high dimensionality of health data creates the need to develop Machine Learning algorithms that can successfully operate at this scale. Overcoming these frontiers in Machine Learning is key to making the vision of Precision Medicine a reality.To meet this challenge, Europe urgently needs a new generation of scientists with knowledge in both machine learning and in health data analysis, who are extremely rare at a global scale. Our ETN’s goal is to close this gap, by bringing together leading European research institutes in Machine Learning and Statistical Genetics, both from the private and public sector, to train 14 early stage researchers. These scientists will help to shape the future of this important topic and increase Europe’s competitiveness in this domain, which will have severe academic and industrial impact in the future and has the potential to shape the healthcare and high tech sector in Europe in the 21st century.",813533

While the design of such an architecture has been addressed by 5G-PPP Phase 1 at a conceptual level, it must be brought into practice in Phase 2. To this end, 5G-MoNArch will (i) evolve 5G-PPP Phase 1 concepts to a fully-fledged architecture, (ii) develop prototype implementations and (iii) apply these prototypes to representative use cases.Approach: 5G-MoNArch architecture design will combine Phase 1 concepts (such as virtualisation, slicing and orchestration of access and core functions) with three enabling innovations that fill gaps not ad-dressed in Phase 1: (i) inter-slice control and cross-domain management, to enable the coordination across slices and domains, (ii) experiment-driven optimization, to leverage experimental results to design highly performing algorithms, and (iii) cloud-enabled protocol stack, to gain flexibility in the orchestration of virtualised functions.Testbeds: The devised architecture will be deployed in two testbeds: (i) the sea port, representative of a vertical industry use case, and (ii) the touristic city, representative of a mobile operator deployment. For each testbed, 5G-MoNArch will instantiate the architecture and complement it with a use case specific functionality – the two functional innovations of 5G-MoNArch: (i) resilience and security, needed to meet the sea port requirements, and (ii) resource elasticity, to make an efficient use of the resources in the touristic city. Impact: 5G-MoNArch has a very high potential for commercial impact, including enhanced products (e.g., orchestrators or edge-cloud RAN), novel services (enabled by network slicing) and opportunities for new market players.

In this context, novel tomography techniques such as Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) for imaging in highly scattering media, and Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) and Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) for imaging in low scattering specimens, are becoming extremely valuable tools in the biology and preclinical labs. However, all these approaches suffer from the same drawback: lack of throughput. This proposal addresses the issue of high-throughput which is currently the bottleneck for the translation of optical tomography as a mainstream imaging technique. The main goal is to improve these setups in order to ensure several subjects can be imaged simultaneously. These changes require significant advances at the software and theoretical levels in addition to specific hardware changes. Main changes will consist on the use of structured illumination and a collection of mirrors and beamsplitters for FMT, and the addition of a vertical displacement in OPT and SPIM to allow stacking of specimens. These changes in hardware need to be accounted for in new inverse models to recover the 3D distribution of fluorophores in-vivo, accounting for the presence of scattering. In order to ensure high-throughput fast inverse algorithms will be developed making use of parallel programming with Graphics Processing Unitgs (GPUs).",333632

Nevertheless, EPT development is currently stuck due to the incomplete understanding of their physics, in particular electromagnetic (EM) plasma heating and anomalous transport. Additionally, the cylindrical geometry of existing EPT designs has inherent issues, with high plasma losses and erosion at the rear wall of the ionization chamber and a wide divergence of the generated plasma jet. ZARATHUSTRA aims to unravel the physical underpinnings of EPTs and revolutionize their design by accomplishing three objectives: (1) establish the first self-consistent model of EM plasma heating in these devices; (2) elucidate the role of plasma turbulence, wall interactions, and applied EM fields on anomalous transport and devise control solutions to minimize plasma losses; and (3) assess the feasibility and advantages of a disruptive non-cylindrical EPT concept. This will be made possible thanks to a unique multidisciplinary methodology based on: a ground-breaking two-level numerical simulation strategy with a novel electromagnetic-kinetic algorithm; state-of-the-art experimental measurements; advanced data analysis techniques; and thruster bread-board prototype development. As a result, the first complete theory of EM heating and anomalous transport in EPTs will be formulated, and the path will be paved for the development of a new generation of plasma thrusters with unsurpassed characteristics and performances. While the high ambition of the project represents high risk, this is more than compensated by the potential high gain: uncovering the physical mechanisms of EPTs, unblocking their progress, and claiming for Europe a privileged leadership position in this strategic field.",950466

Opera was invented to recover the power of Ancient music to move the human heart, and its history is a permanent exploration of the capacity of action, words and music to convey emotions. In the eighteenth century a new type of opera consolidated with the chief concern of expressing the character’s emotions as they changed throughout the drama, inspired by Descartes’ theory of human passions. The key expressive medium was the aria col da capo, where a single, distinct passion was represented, like a concentrated pill of emotional meaning. The ideal corpus to study this issue are the 900 operas set to music by 300 composers on the 27 dramas by Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782). It contains a comprehensive catalogue of emotions in music, a unique window of opportunity to scrutinize conventions that defined music expression and meaning for over a century, paving the way for the emergence of ‘absolute’ instrumental music, autonomous from any other art form.DIDONE presents an innovative approach to unveil these conventions: the creation of a corpus of 4,000 digitized arias from 200 opera scores based on Metastasio’s eight most popular dramas, to be analysed using traditional methods and big data computer technology. The comparative scrutiny of dozens of different musical settings of the same librettos will reveal how composers correlate specific dramatic circumstances and emotions with distinct poetic and musical features.

To achieve this, the project will work to create a more appealing and legitimate EU social contract draft that will be submitted to inhabitants, Member States and EU institutions that will have the possibility to participate and decide upon the conditions, rights, and obligations to be binding. The goal is to strengthen the EU agreement of association by promoting social dialogue, civic engagement, and integration. An express draft shall be achieved by means of policy dialogue, campaign implementation, collaborative workshops, advocacy planning, and innovative offline and online formats and tools to create spaces for dialogue. To this end, EXPRESS2 will involve EU policymakers and institutions throughout the project to obtain a more appealing and legitimate EU social contract draft. The project will also focus on identifying and analyzing disruptive elements of the social contract, such as insecurity, populism, climate change, mistrust in institutions, gender discrimination, digitalisation and pandemics. The analysis of these stressors includes both individualised and cross-sectional approaches to cover the plausible relation of multiple disruptors, their concatenation or the “trigger” effect of a disruptive phenomenon to another. By understanding these disruptive elements and their effects on the social contract, the project will propose concrete measures to ironclad the social contract and it will provide relevant information to protect it from actual and potential disruptions thus we conceive social contracts as incomplete theorised agreements and living documents.

However, the ultimate hope to use all this information for personalized medicine, that is to tailor medical treatment to the needs of an individual, remains largely unfulfilled.To turn the vision of personalized medicine into reality, many methodological problems remain to be solved: there is a lack of methods that allow us to gain a causal understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms, including gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Similarly, there is an urgent need for integration of the heterogeneous patient data currently available, for improved and robust biomarker discovery for disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapy outcome prediction.The field of machine learning, which tries to detect patterns, rules and statistical dependencies in large datasets, has also witnessed dramatic progress over the last decade and has had a profound impact on the Internet. Amongst others, advanced methods for high-dimensional feature selection, causality inference, and data integration have been developed or are topics of current research. These techniques address many of the key methodological challenges that personalized medicine faces today and keep it from rising to the next level.Despite this rich potential of machine learning in personalized medicine, its impact on data-driven medicine remains low, due to a lack of experts with knowledge in both machine learning and in statistical genetics. Our ITN aims to close this gap by bringing together leading European research institutes in Machine Learning and Statistical Genetics, both from the private and public sector, to train 14 early stage researchers.""",316861

In particular I aim to understand how different characteristics of the market such as frequency of trade and transparency affect the efficiency with which these markets operate. This is a stepping stone to then be able to understand how these markets can be designed or regulated to improve their efficiency. Allowing for competition among market places can also indicate if the best way to intervene in these markets is by fostering competition or if direct government intervention is called for. Second, market imperfections are exacerbated in developing countries due to the poor rule of law and poor institutional framework. Thus, important welfare gains can potentially be achieved by mitigating these imperfections and fostering the development of markets. I plan to work on these issues by combining theoretical analysis with controlled randomized trials to validate the theoretical insights in the field. For example there are many durable goods such as solar lights that would greatly enhance the welfare of poor rural households. These markets have been very slow to develop due to the lack of credit of final consumers and uncertainty about product quality. By properly designing the self-enforcing agreements between the producers of these goods and the retailers we can ensure retailers get access to financing from the producers. In turn this would allow retailers to extend financing to final consumers. Work on the field will surely uncover other frictions which we can study theoretically how to overcome and again test in the field with further controlled randomized trials.",681575

This will include validation of the viral pilot batches and the GMP viral vector lot, the establishment of SOPs,the identification and selection of the best  GMP culture system and the scale-up of the graft preparation. A clinical-grade cell bank of primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts  will be established from 3 selected RDEB patients who are tolerant  towards type VII collagen. Determination of transgene integrity, analysis of the proliferative capacities of transduced keratinocytes and the level of type VII collagen expression will be assessed.

We can successfully train actuators with probes in a controlled environment to reach a certain goal, e.g. aerodynamic drag minimization or noise reduction; on the other hand, an experimental technique that provides a full description of the flow is not available, thus generalization of the actuation effects to real applications is often prohibitive.The objective of NEXTFLOW is to conceive the next-generation flow-diagnostics aimed to flow control by leveraging the principles of completeness and compactness of the measurements. Completeness implies aiming to pursue a complete flow description, i.e. a time-resolved 3D characterization of velocity and thermodynamic variables. This will be achieved through a technique-integration approach based on data-driven methods. This grounds its basis on the principle that the superposed application of techniques is superior to their separate use. Compactness is pursued by exploring solutions with minimum technological complexity, and on developing new data output formats that are directly aimed at flow control applications. Key enablers for this task are (i) the novel concepts I recently proposed on data-driven techniques integration, (ii) the deep embedding of compressed-sensing methods in the data processing and (iii) the data-driven discovery of simplified governing equations of the dynamics.

However, there is public scepticism about intensification in livestock production driven primarily by adverse links to environmental aspects and sustainable utilization of natural resources. Moreover, ILPS are perceived as being detrimental to animal health & welfare and may potentially undermine the quality of derived products. Extensive livestock production systems are low-input systems which are critical to support the development of rural communities. However, economic sustainability of such systems is often questioned as they are challenged by natural resource limitations, adverse climatic conditions and diseases. Products from extensive systems are considered of superior quality, but their resource-limited environment undermines their safety. Understanding key strengths & weaknesses of different farming systems is crucial for sustainable production and delivery of quality products. Therefore, strategic planning and a profitability analysis considering the system-oriented challenges and the added-value resulting from consumer-driven demands and niche products are necessary. Dairy cattle and swine production are the most significant livestock sectors in Europe. However, our proposal will take a different approach. When compared to cattle & swine production, both poultry and goat production systems are more resilient, sustainable and adaptable to change. Code:Re-Farm focuses on poultry & goat production systems with the goal of understanding the links between husbandry systems and intrinsic quality of derived products.

The last decades brought an exponential increase in mobile traffic volume. This will continue and a 1000-fold increase by 2020 has been forecasted. Small-cells promise to provide the required data rates through an increased spatial utilisation of the spectrum.<br/>Problem statement. Due to strong inter-cell interference, small-cell deployments will require a high degree of coordination as offered by centralised processing. Furthermore, heterogeneous backhaul solutions will be used to connect small-cells and core network. So far, access and backhaul are individually designed and therefore not optimised. In order to support centralised processing and a heterogeneous backhaul, challenges on access and backhaul must be simultaneously tackled.<br/>Approach. iJOIN introduces the novel concept RAN-as-a-Service (RANaaS), where RAN functionality is flexibly centralised through an open IT platform based on a cloud infrastructure. iJOIN aims for a joint design and optimisation of access and backhaul, operation and management algorithms, and architectural elements, integrating small-cells, heterogeneous backhaul, and centralised processing. Additionally to the development of technology candidates across PHY, MAC, and the network layer, iJOIN will study the requirements, constraints, and implications for existing mobile networks, specifically 3GPP LTE-A.<br/>Results. iJOIN will design new network operation and management algorithms in the context of RANaaS, show their implications on 3GPP LTE, and evaluate the derived technologies with respect to four quantitative key objectives:<br/>1) system throughput2) energy-efficiency3) cost-efficiency4) utilisation-efficiency<br/>iJOIN will further impact<br/>1) the research community by identifying new challenges,2) business opportunities through new concepts for implementing mobile networks, and3) standardisation through strong industry participation of all major stakeholders.",317941

It has a considerable advantage in terms of global system cost, where a reduction of at least a factor of 2 is expected, and reliability compared to mature technologies. It is also scalable and can potentially be considered for all electric propulsion applications, from microsatellites to space tugs. Although the first results obtained with ECRA have been encouraging, the complexity of the physics at play has been an obstacle for the understanding and development of the technology. Thus an in-depth numerical and experimental investigation plan has been devised for the project, in order to bring the technology from TRL3 to TRL5. The strong consortium is composed of academic experts to perform the research activities on ECRA, including alternative propellants, along with experienced industrial partners to quantify its disruptive advantages on the propulsion subsystem and its market positioning.ECRA’s advantages as an electric thruster technology can be a disruptive force in a mostly cost-driven satellite market. It would increase European competitiveness, help develop low-cost satellite missions such as constellations, provide end-of-life propulsion, and pave the way for future emerging electric propulsion technologies.The 36 months MINOTOR project requests a total EC grant of 1 485 809 M€ for an experienced consortium of 7 partners from 4 countries: ONERA (FR, Coordinator), industries Thales Alenia Space (BE), Thales Microelectronics (FR), SNECMA (FR), Universities Carlos III (ES) and Giessen (GE), and SME L-up (FR).",730028

In linear panel data models it is well known how to control for permanent unobserved heterogeneity in a robust way, i.e. without assuming any parametric distribution of the heterogeneity on the population. In contrast the problem is much more difficult in nonlinear models. A significant part of the research on microeconometrics in the recent years has been about dealing with this issue and many solutions have been proposed. A first objective of this proposal is to study how well the bias correction methods recently proposed work for other specific nonlinear models and data set of interest in applied econometrics. This will provide practitioners with reliable evidence about whether the methods work for the case they are interested in and which method is better among the many that have been proposed.  Unobserved heterogeneity in dynamic discrete choice models is usually only allowed through a specific constant individual term, as in linear panel data models. However, in nonlinear cases that assumption implies further strong restrictions in the model and previous explorations seems to indicate that we should allow for more heterogeneity. A second objective of this proposal is to analyze identification of a dynamic discrete choice panel model where not only the intercept but also the slope is heterogeneous. This will include to (i) see how much restrictions we have to impose on the distribution to point identify the model (or its parameters of interest) from a cross-section of a fixed periods; and (ii) study further the non-identified situations of that model by looking for partial identification. The interest on this is to know how much heterogeneity can be identify from a given data set, the minimum restrictions we have imposed to get point estimates of the parameters of interests, and what we still can learn if we do not imposed all those restrictions.",219359

This growing demand can only be satisfied by increasing the density of points of access and combining different wireless technologies. Mobile network operators have already started to push for denser, heterogeneous deployments; however, current technology needs to steer towards efficiency, to avoid unsustainable energy consumption and network performance implosion due to interference. While some efforts have already been devoted to evolving the technology, these efforts mostly take a restricted PHY perspective and do not consider higher-layer mechanisms, which are required to fully optimise global performance.In this context, CROWD promotes a paradigm shift in the future Internet architecture towards global network cooperation, dynamic network functionality configuration and fine, on demand, capacity tuning. The project targets very dense heterogeneous wireless access networks and integrated wireless-wired backhaul networks. In this framework, CROWD pursues four key goals: i) bringing density-proportional capacity where it is needed, ii) optimising MAC mechanisms operating in very dense deployments by explicitly accounting for density as a resource rather than as an impediment, iii) enabling traffic-proportional energy consumption, and iv) guaranteeing mobile user's quality of experience by designing smarter connectivity management solutions.The technology developed by the project will be designed taking into account the requirements for commercial deployment. Exploitation plans comprise a thorough roadmap for standardisation that includes the support letters from chairs of the relevant groups at IETF, IRTF, IEEE and Femto Forum.

However, the flat storage hierarchies found in classic HPC architectures no longer satisfy the performance requirements of data-processing applications. Uncoordinated file access in combination with limited bandwidth make the centralised back-end parallel file system a serious bottleneck. At the same time, emerging multi-tier storage hierarchies come with the potential to remove this barrier. But maximising performance still requires careful control to avoid congestion and balance computational with storage performance. Unfortunately, appropriate interfaces and policies for managing such an enhanced I/O stack are still lacking.The main objective of the ADMIRE project is to establish this control by creating an active I/O stack that dynamically adjusts computation and storage requirements through intelligent global coordination, malleability of computation and I/O, and the scheduling of storage resources along all levels of the storage hierarchy. To achieve this, we will develop a software-defined framework based on the principles of scalable monitoring and control, separated control and data paths, and the orchestration of key system components and applications through embedded control points. Our software-only solution will allow the throughput of HPC systems and the performance of individual applications to be substantially increased – and consequently energy consumption to be decreased – by taking advantage of fast and power-efficient node-local storage tiers using novel, European ad-hoc storage systems and in-transit/in-situ processing facilities. Furthermore, our enhanced I/O stack will offer quality-of-service (QoS) and resilience.

There, one keystone for robots to carry out accurate and intelligent tasks, with and for people, is their ability both to handle autonomously all sorts of objects and to use human tools. However, today's robots are unable to achieve dexterous and fine manipulation, especially when this requires in-hand manipulation. They are far from being able to understand and reason about their environments, their goals and their own capabilities, to learn skills and improve their performance by what they have been taught and their own experience, to interact with their environments with the efficiency of humans.The HANDLE project aims at understanding how humans perform the manipulation of objects in order to replicate grasping and skilled in-hand movements with an anthropomorphic artificial hand, and thereby move robot grippers from current best practice towards more autonomous, natural and effective articulated hands. The project implies not only focusing on technological developments but also working with fundamental multidisciplinary research aspects in order to endow the robotic hand system with advanced perception capabilities, high level feedback control and elements of intelligence that allow recognition of objects and context, reasoning about actions and a high degree of recovery from failure during the execution of dexterous tasks.Integrating findings from disciplines such as neuroscience, developmental psychology, cognitive science, robotics, multimodal perception and machine learning, the method we will develop is based on an original blend of learning and predicting behaviours from imitation and ""babbling"" to allow the robot to be capable of responding to gaps in its knowledge.",231640

There is no lack of pension finance projections and policy advice for pension reforms and their socio-economic effects, including active ageing and the role of elder citizens in transforming our economies into “silver economies”.Much less is known about the second great transformation that will follow the pension wave. In the mid2030s, the health of the baby boomers will have deteriorated and many in these large cohorts will be in need of formal and/or informal long-term care. This “care wave” will transform two generations: the baby boomers in need of care and their children who may supply care. It will have significant implications for labour supply, especially for women, saving behaviour, and therefore for productivity, economic growth and its inclusiveness.

A new metro network infrastructure is envisioned, fitting the network operator roadmap and targeting at least a tenfold reduction in components energy consumption and footprint. These breakthroughs are achieved by developing all the essential photonic building blocks. On the transmitter side a novel 3D stacked modular design will be developed combining a silicon photonics (SiPh) circuit layer with directly modulated high-bandwidth 1550nm VCSELs light sources. At the receiver side we will develop novel InP based coherent receiver arrays which handle polarization on chip making polarization handling off chip unnecessary. Finally, we will develop a compact and cost-effective switching concept which can support the Pb/s capacities generated by the transceiver modules, using a combination of InP and SiPh PICs. Increased system flexibility and modularity is obtained by sliceable bandwidth/bitrate variable transceivers. The resulting solution will offer scalability, programmability and re-configurability using agile aggregation in spectrum, polarization and space dimensions. PASSION will contribute to reinforce European industrial technological leadership in high-capacity photonic devices and sub-systems, addressing the growing market of metro network scenarios, improving business opportunities in Europe.

Although there are different promising areas of application of GANs  – e.g. audio-graphic productions, human-computer interactions, satire, artistic creative expression – their current and foreseen misleading uses are just as numerous and worrying. The main concern is related to the so-called “deepfakes”, fake images or videos simulating real events with extreme precision. If trained on a face, GANs can make it move and speak in a hyper-realistic way. This technology poses an urgent political threat since GANs could be – and have already been – used to spread fake news and disinformation.This raises an urgent challenge to democratic governance and regulation: to improve GANs accountability, transparency, and trustworthiness. Nevertheless, GANs also constitute an opportunity to enhance democratic awareness and expand active and inclusive citizenship.SOLARIS reacts to these challenges in two ways. On the one hand, we analyse political risks associated with these technologies, to prevent negative implications for EU democracies. As a result, SOLARIS will establish regulatory innovations to detect and mitigate deepfake risks. On the other hand, we assess the opportunities raised by GANs for reinvigorating the democratic engagement of citizens. We will co-create, involving citizen science, value-based GANs contents to enhance democratic engagement. SOLARIS involves three use cases: the first aims at understanding the psychological aspects of GANs perceived trustworthiness. The second simulates the circulation of threatening GANs contents on social media, to detect risks and design mitigation strategies. The third co-creates value-based GANs contents to boost awareness on key global democratic topics (e.g: climate change, gender dimension, human migration), to ultimately enhance active and inclusive digital citizenship.",101094665

To succeed, the solution will target determinism network infrastructures at large, including wired and wireless segments and their interconnections. PREDICT-6G will develop a novel Multi-technology Multi-domain Data-Plane (MDP) overhauling the reliability and time sensitiveness design features existing in current wired and wireless standards. The ambition is for the MDP design to be inherently deterministic. To achieve this, PREDICT-6G will develop an AI-driven Multi-stakeholder Inter-domain Control-Plane (AICP) for the provisioning of deterministic network paths to support time sensitive services as requested by end-customers and with different scaling ambitions, e.g., from the network in a single vehicle to a large, geographically dispersed network. This requires timely monitoring and prediction of the behavior of the complete network, including identifying potential sources of quality violations and analyzing various routes of the traffic flows. These capabilities will be delivered through the PREDICT-6G AI-powered Digital Twin (DT) framework, allowing the prediction of the behavior of the end-to-end network infrastructure, and enabling anticipative control and validation of the network provisions to meet the real-world time-sensitive and reliability requirements of the running services.",101095890

In the thriving field of regenerative medicine, deposition processes to manufacture artificial skin in vitro turn out to be particularly challenging. Because skin is composed of several layers with specific cell distributions, space-resolved deposition of cells has to be achieved to obtain viable tissues. However, the delicate nature of living cells and biomaterials strongly limits the number of available techniques, thereby hindering further advances in the field.In this context, COCONUTE emerges as a timely and essential initiative to adapt a well-known technique, dip-coating, to meet the challenges posed by current skin manufacturing technologies. I will investigate, using theoretical and experimental tools, key unknown aspects of the physics of dip-coating in the presence of two liquids, which may have particles in suspension. Gaining further understanding of the physics, I will be able to create compound coatings exhibiting well-controlled arrangements of particles. These particles will have physical properties similar to skin cells to guarantee the applicability of the results to tissue-on-a-chip setups.Not only the time to implement this project is now: the group and supervisors with whom I will carry out my research make a perfect ecosystem for me to turn the project into a success. Being a Soft Matter physicist by training, I will work in a group where fluid mechanicians collaborate routinely with experts in tissue engineering.

Indeed, while some assurance approaches have been implemented in a few countries, they remain insufficient to provide breeder documents in complete security and trustworthiness at a time when this is increasingly necessary.This project will therefore investigate exhaustively the current state of passport breeder documents requirements and issuing practices in Member States/Associated Countries. The identification of common security gaps will lead to the recommendation of possible solutions to overcome the security weaknesses in breeder documents. The project will provide support for issuance bodies and border control communities. It will also promote the standardisation of breeder documents by creating a dedicated working group at a European level.These objectives will be achieved through the establishment of a strong networking environment between key actors in the sector (passport breeder document and e-passport communities, border control community, ministries, industry, SMEs, universities, NGOs, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, …), exchange and dissemination of good practices between relevant communities, the definition and organisation of joint or common initiatives, meetings, conferences, events and with an appropriate management of the action.

We will provide new indicators and implementation studies on social investment, working conditions, minimum income protection and housing. The project is deliberately ambitious in terms of both science and policy because effective policies require in-depth analysis of current realities and alternative policy options, both empirically and conceptually. The consortium has been formed to realise that ambition, by combining academic expertise – in political science, law, sociology, social policy and economics – with practical policy experience.

Two major obstacles in the way of such development are poor understanding of the olfactory code (the link between odorant structure, neural activity, and odor perception), and technical inability to emit odors in a reversible manner. Here we propose a novel multidisciplinary path to solving this basic scientific question (the code), and in doing so generate a solution to the technical limitation (controlled odor emission). The Bachelet lab will design DNA strands that assume a 3D structure that will specifically bind to a single type of olfactory receptor and induce signal transduction. These DNA-based """"artificial odorants"""" will be tagged with a nanoparticle that changes their conformation in response to an external electromagnetic field. Thus, we will have in hand an artificial odorant that is remotely switchable. The Hansson lab will use tissue culture cells expressing insect olfactory receptors, functional imaging, and behavioral tests to validate the function and selectivity of these switchable odorants in insects. The Carleton lab will use imaging in order to investigate the patterns of neural activity induced by these artificial odorants in rodents. The Sobel lab will apply these artificial odorants to the human olfactory system, and measure perception and neural activity following switching the artificial smell on and off. Finally, given a potential role for olfactory receptors in skin, the Del Rio lab will test the efficacy of these artificial odorants in promoting wound healing. At the basic science level, this approach may allow solving the combinatorial code of olfaction. At the technology level, beyond novel pharmacology, we will provide proof-of-concept for countless novel applications ranging from insect pest-control to odor-controlled environments and odor-emitting devices such as televisions, phones, and computers.""",662629

The analysis will be performed against simple panels in the first place. The best configurations will then be studied as aircraft representative structures. Two different types of impactor will be considered from the engine failure, a metallic fragment (which will be related to an engine core part) and a composite fragment (which represents the failure of the blade).There are two overarching objectives in this project. The first one is to validate the maturity level of different technologies and structural solutions, to protect the rear-end structure from different impacts associated to engine failure. To this end both real and virtual impact tests of debris associated with the open rotor engine failure will be performed. The second objective of this project is to advance in the development of virtual testing methodologies. The economic impact of performing real experimental tests for the aircraft companies is very high, and virtual testing could diminish the number of experimental tests (and hence their economic impact).Both numerical and experimental approaches will be taken into account. Experimental tests will be performed by means of a pneumatic launcher, in order to achieve the impact velocities representatives of such event; high speed cameras, strain gauges, and 3D digital image correlation will be used to obtain the maximum quantity of data from the tests. Once impacted, non-destructive techniques will be used to determine the type and extension of the damage. Numerical simulations of the impact process will be also performed; a complete numerical methodology will be developed in order to appropriately model the phenomenon. After validation with the experimental tests, the numerical model will be used to perform parametric studies.",715873

Added value is generated by a) delivery of customized information and services via user-centric interfaces (dashboards, cockpits); b) gathering of data consensually provided by migrants and helpers in their cockpits; c) creation of strategic operational knowledge through data analysis and visualisation; and d) direct communication and data exchange between involved stakeholders and institutions. Key technical innovations are chatbot language interfaces and automatic translation services for the migrants' cockpit, which facilitate access to integration services, communication with authorities, and data acquisition. Besides the technical solution, MICADO creates in local co-design sessions a universal service package, e.g. location and activity mapping, personal profiling, or matchmaking for mentors, jobs, education, etc. The workplan ensures extensive demand analysis and co-creation with user groups in the pilot locations.

FMP is an operational position located in Area Control Centres (ACC) which serves as an interface between Air Traffic Control (ATC) and the Network Manager (NM) Operations Centre. FMP monitors the level of traffic in ATC sectors, adjusts the value of capacity in view of unexpected events, and coordinates possible traffic flow measures with the ACC Supervisor and the NM when an excess of demand over capacity is detected. The presence of storms challenges ATC: it makes the sector demand not easy to predict and increases the complexity, thus reducing the sector capacity. The overall objective of FMP-Met is to provide the FMP with an intuitive and interpretable probabilistic assessment of the impact of convective weather on the operations, up to 8 hours in advance, coming from the combination of the probabilistic sector demand, complexity and capacity reduction, to allow better-informed decision making. FMP-Met has the following specific objectives: Tailor multi-scale, multi-source convective weather information for FMP application; forecast multi-sector demand and complexity under convective weather; translate convective weather forecasts into predictions of reduced airspace capacity; and produce guidelines on the use of probabilistic forecasts for FMP application. The expected impact of this project is the enhancement of ATM efficiency by improving decision making in traffic flow management under convective weather.

We propose to design a novel FISHY platform able to securely orchestrate a supply chain consisting of complex ICT systems end-to-end, - from the IoT ecosystem and the edge and cloud infrastructure over to the networking infrastructure connecting -, and enabling functionalities related to risks and vulnerabilities management, accountability and mitigation strategies as well as security metrics and evidence-based security assurance. Conceptually, FISHY platform uses intent-based interfaces to orchestrate both existing and beyond state-of-the-art security appliances in composed ICT scenarios leveraging capabilities of programmable network and IT infrastructure through a coordinated management. FISHY implements new strategies to leveraging data analytics, distributed ledger technology, intent-based security service orchestration, artificial intelligence and programmable network infrastructure. The platform is envisioned not only to facilitating adaptive system reconfigurations, but also reacting to and defying the effects of cyber attacks in real time of the ICT supply chain end-to-end, and in particular in the IoT domain. Finally, the FISHY proposes a comprehensive validation and demonstration strategy built upon three use cases from different sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing and transportation.

In this research agenda, I propose to push out the frontier in the area of Energy and Environmental Economics by carrying out policy-relevant research on a pressing issue: how to design optimal regulatory and market-based solutions to achieve a least cost transition towards a low-carbon economy. The European experience provides unique natural experiments with which to test some of the most contentious issues that arise in the context of electricity markets, including the potential to change households’ demand patterns through dynamic pricing, the scope of renewables to mitigate market power and depress wholesale market prices, and the design and performance of the auctions for renewable support. While there is a body of policy work on these issues, it generally does not meet the required research standards. In this research, I will rely on cutting-edge theoretical, empirical, and simulation tools to disentangle these topics, while providing key economic insights that are relevant beyond electricity markets. On the theory front, I propose to develop new models that incorporate the intermittency of renewables to characterize optimal bidding as a key, broadly omitted ingredient in previous analysis. In turn, these models will provide a rigorous structure for the empirical and simulation analysis, which will rely both on traditional econometrics for casual inference as well as on state-of-the-art machine learning methods to construct counterfactual scenarios for policy analysis. While my focus is on energy and environmental issues, my research will also provide methodological contributions for other areas - particularly those related to policy design and policy evaluation. The conclusions of this research should prove valuable for academics, as well as to policy makers to assess the impact of environmental and energy policies and redefine them where necessary.",772331

However, the flat storage hierarchies found in classic HPC architectures no longer satisfy the performance requirements of data-processing applications. Uncoordinated file access in combination with limited bandwidth make the centralised back-end parallel file system a serious bottleneck. At the same time, emerging multi-tier storage hierarchies come with the potential to remove this barrier. But maximising performance still requires careful control to avoid congestion and balance computational with storage performance. Unfortunately, appropriate interfaces and policies for managing such an enhanced I/O stack are still lacking.The main objective of the ADMIRE project is to establish this control by creating an active I/O stack that dynamically adjusts computation and storage requirements through intelligent global coordination, malleability of computation and I/O, and the scheduling of storage resources along all levels of the storage hierarchy. To achieve this, we will develop a software-defined framework based on the principles of scalable monitoring and control, separated control and data paths, and the orchestration of key system components and applications through embedded control points. Our software-only solution will allow the throughput of HPC systems and the performance of individual applications to be substantially increased – and consequently energy consumption to be decreased – by taking advantage of fast and power-efficient node-local storage tiers using novel, European ad-hoc storage systems and in-transit/in-situ processing facilities.

Therefore, it is important to investigate alternative batteries. Recent years have seen the emergence of post-LiB, like sodium-, magnesium- or calcium technologies. The last one is very promising in terms of theoretical energy density, safety, and sustainability. However, the lack of reliable electrolytes so far impedes the practical research on rechargeable calcium batteries, CaB. In this proposal VIDICAT aims at developing a new material concept based on nanocomposite ionomers acting both as liquid-free electrolyte and electrode binders. Such approach will provide at the interface with calcium, highly chemically, electrochemically and thermally stable polymer electrolytes. Due to outstanding mechanical performance, very thin electrolytes (1 µm) are targeted, with cationic conductance close to standard lithium ones. In the frame of developing this ground-breaking electrolyte concept, VIDICAT will also search for positive electrodes with the final challenging purpose of proposing reliable and safe CaB.

Can existing disparities in effort by social background be explained by (a) the intergenerational transmission of effort from parents to children, and (b) varying motivations and differential susceptibility to incentives?

The BONE-proposal does not look into issues as convergence between mobile and fixed networks, nor does it consider issues regarding the optimised broadband access in the last mile using a wide variety of technologies such as DSL, cable, WiMAX, WiFi, PLC,... The BONE-proposal looks further into the future and takes as the final ""Network of the Future"":- a high capacity, flexible, reconfigurable and self-healing optical Core and Metro network which supports the transport of massive amounts of data- a FTTx solution in which the ""x"" is as close as possible to the home, at the home, or even in the home. From this point the user is connected using terminal-specific technologies (wireless to handheld devices, fiber to home cinema, wireless to laptop, fixed connection to desktop,...)BONE clearly identifies the existence of the current technologies and also recognizes the fact that users also require the mobility of wireless access, but this mobile connection ends at a gateway or access points and from there a fixed connection is required and this fixed connection will finally be an optical link.",216863

In particular, two problems are considered: 1) trajectory planning and 2) sector demand analysis, both at the pre-tactical level (up to three hours before departure) and tactical level (during the flight).In each problem two types of meteorological uncertainty are considered: wind uncertainty and convective zones (including individual storm cells). Weather predictions will be based on Ensemble Prediction Systems and Nowcasts.At the trajectory scale, the main objective is to assess and improve the predictability of efficient 4D trajectories when weather uncertainty is taken into account. To reach this goal, a methodology based on the use of stochastic optimal control algorithms will be explored for robust trajectory planning at the pre-tactical level. At the tactical level, various tactics will be investigated to avoid storms by using a Monte-Carlo method. At the sector scale, the main objective is to analyse the impact of the previously developed trajectory planning on sector demand. To achieve this objective, a methodology will be developed to measure the uncertainty of sector demand (probabilistic sector loading) based on the uncertainty of the individual trajectories. This analysis will also provide an understanding of how weather uncertainty propagates from the trajectory scale to the sector scale. All the solutions proposed in this project will be evaluated and assessed using an advanced air traffic simulator.This project is fully aligned with the call, where the following objectives are stated: “to enhance meteorological capabilities and their integration into ATM planning processes for improving ATM efficiency” and “to develop 4D trajectories that are optimised to take account of all environmental considerations”.",699294

The interest of the topic relies in the fact that advances in semiconductor technology, favourable spectrum policy and demand for gigabit throughput capabilities have created an opportunity for millimetre wave radio technology above 100GHz. The iPHOS research plan aims to address what has been identified as the ""Achilles heel"" of systems operating in this frequency range: the lack of reliable, compact low cost sources which can give rise to commercially successful products.We propose optical techniques to generate the carrier wave, enabling us to integrate a high level of functionality such as tunability of the carrier wave and modulation to superimpose data. The carrier frequency will result from beating two optical modes from dual mode laser on a high speed photodiode with an integrated antenna. The technical challenge that iPHOS is going to address is the integration of all of these elements on a single chip, including dual-wavelength sources, passive waveguide for optical couplers and connecting waveguides, electro-optical modulators for data encoding and high speed photodiode for electro-optical conversion. This challenge will require a strong effort on chip integration. In addition, advanced packaging technology will contribute to the goal of providing a compact and rugged system.The first application field targeted by iPHOS are future on-board flight entertainment systems, effort led by partner THALES.

Not following the ‘one system fits all services’ paradigm of current architectures, 5G NORMA will allow for adapting the mechanisms executed for a given service to the specific service requirements, resulting in a novel service- and context-dependent adaptation of network functions paradigm.The technical approach is based on the innovative concept of adaptive (de)composition and allocation of mobile network functions, which flexibly decomposes the mobile network functions and places the resulting functions in the most appropriate location. By doing so, access and core functions no longer (necessarily) reside in different locations, which is exploited to jointly optimize their operation when possible. The adaptability of the architecture is further strengthened by the innovative software-defined mobile network control and mobile multi-tenancy concepts, and underpinned by corroborating demonstrations.5G NORMA will ensure economic sustainability of network operation and open opportunities for new players, while leveraging the efficiency of the architecture to do so in a cost- and energy- effective way.""",671584

Examples include innovative activeties such as book publishing, research and development, technology adoption in developing countries, and drafting rules and laws in bureaucratic setting.We introduce in relational contracts framework imprecision about the prospects of actions. Imprecision is formulated as ‘ambiguity’ by building on recent developments in decision theoretic literature. The aim in this project is to explore how the interaction of imprecise perceptions about the consequences of actions and moral hazard introduce new conceptual and analytical issues and how such an interaction plays a role in shaping dynamic relational incentives. An understanding of these questions is relevant not only for motivating research and development, but also for diverse applications including technology adoption in developing countries, book publishing, as well as drafting new policies and rules of law.  In publishing an author will typically have some imprecise information about the new project as previous experience is only partly relevant for new venture, and possibly better information in writing the book than the publisher. Technology adoption in developing countries is similarly dynamic process of experimentation and learning via relationship. Local entrepreneurs have better yet imprecise ideas about new technologies and new practices than development agencies.

Based on CHEOPS Phase I results, CHEOPS MEDIUM POWER will perform incremental developments on system and sub-system levels in order to achieve TRL6/7 by 2023.CHEOPS MEDIUM POWER will further mature the different system elements (Thruster Unit, PPU, FMS) by addressing the following key challenges: non-recurring and recurring cost reduction in terms of design, manufacturing, test qualification and time to deliver, as well as propellent efficiency in order to increase valuable payload and generate revenues. These advancements will fit into a less than 10kg thruster working at both 250 and 400V. CHEOPS MEDIUM POWER will deliver for the thruster unit an optimised design for a very high thrust and improved lifecycle durations. On an industrial level the project aims at reduced fabrication cycles, improved quality, leaner manufacture, faster assembly lead times, and improved tolerance management. The Power processing unit will be optimised by removing unnecessary functions and re-selecting cheaper key components with at least constant reliability levels. The project’s scope extends to FMS level where space qualifiable COTS will be used to provide maximum mission suitability for variable number of thrusters per satellite. CHEOPS MEDIUM POWER will have a medium-term impact on the European space industry and its overall competitiveness, but also on the satellite design and manufacturing paradigm in the long term.",101004226

Challenges not only in terms of precision manufacturing (precision engineering <0.01%) but also in the adequate interaction between the different constituent materials.Besides multi-material micro-system manufacturing processes still show to be time and cost consuming mainly from assembling activities and back en processes (35-60% of the total manufacturing costs come only from the assembling), so further research efforts in alternative and more integrated manufacturing concepts(over-moulding of micro-components and in-mould assembly technology would avoid the assembly step) are needed.To answer those problems the development of high-throughput and cost-efficient process chains based on micro injection should consider the following aspects:• Improved volume production, not only from the standpoint of the necessary accuracy and performance of the process, but also regarding the interaction/bonding of the different materials which make up the produced parts and the possibility of selective functionality of their surfaces.• The integration of the different processes including the feeding and handling systems for automatic operation in order to eliminate human intervention and manufacturing costs.• Analyse the most suitable process control, online verification and back-end processes taking into account the features of the multi-material replicated parts represented by five demonstrators.The aim is to reduce manufacturing costs up to 40%.

An efficient way to get precise and reliable information is to rely on spectroscopic analysis and, among the existing technologies, Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy (TDLS) has been identified to be the most attractive solution due to the unique adsorption spectrum of chemicals, allowing their unambiguous detection. In the MIR region, the availability of Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCL) covering a broad portion of the spectral range (MIR, 3-12 µm), where many chemicals of interest for Safety & Security have their strongest absorption lines, has recently pushed forward the commercialisation of TDLS-based detection units.Further technology advancements are still needed in the TDLS and QCL domains, the crucial bottlenecks being the range of tuneability, the footprint, power consumption & wallplug efficiency. Besides high cost and poor versatility, these limitations set a barrier for the realisation of powerful versatile detection units. To address these issues, MIRIFISENS will bring major technological advancements in the field of miniaturisation, process development, heterogeneous integration and co-integration of MOEMS functionalities.The project will exploit state-of-the-art micro and nano-fabrication techniques.

It is thus expected that enhanced mobile-broadband services will be complemented by new services centered on machine-type communications (MTC). An important emerging area among MTC systems is that of low-latency communications, which targets systems that require reliable real-time communication with stringent requirements on latency and reliability.The design of low-latency wireless communication systems is a great challenge, since it requires a fundamentally different design approach than the one used in current high-rate systems. Indeed, current systems exchange packets of several thousand bits. For such packet lengths, there are error-correcting codes that can correct transmission errors with high probability at rates close to the capacity. Consequently, the design of current systems is supported by the extensive information-theoretical knowledge we have about wireless communications. In contrast, low-latency systems exchange packets of only several hundred bits, so the rate of the error-correcting code must be significantly below the capacity to achieve the desired reliability. Consequently, for such systems, capacity is not a relevant performance measure, and design guidelines that are based on its behavior will be misleading.Currently, we are lacking the theoretical understanding of low-latency wireless communication systems that would be crucial to design them optimally. The presented project addresses this problem by establishing the theoretical framework required to describe the fundamental tradeoffs in low-latency wireless communications. The project's vision is that finite-blocklength information theory will play the same role for low-latency systems as information theory has for current systems.",714161

However, there is huge room for improvement, as current clinical PET scanners are limited to spatial resolutions higher than 2.5 mm and temporal resolutions longer than 5 seconds. This hampers applications of PET for preclinical research and clinical diagnosis in small tissues or lesions and precludes real-time reconstruction of metabolic images. RETIMAGER is a proposal for a molecular imaging system with a ten-fold spatial and temporal improvement on the reconstructed image with respect to current PET devices. This will not only boost the quantitative performance, but it will enable new applications in cardiology, vascular oncology, oncology, neurology, and other areas. We will achieve this milestone by developing smart radiation detectors with non-conventional geometries that combine the advantages of both pixelated and monolithic detectors, the two dominant and seemingly incompatible technologies employed in PET scanners. Our new scanner will provide 0.25 mm pixel resolvability with time frames as short as 0.01 sec. By aggregating these blocks in a unique gantry self-adapting to the geometry of the field-of-view, RETIMAGER will achieve an unprecedented increase in sensitivity and in in vivo real-time imaging with submillimeter resolution. We will pair it with high-throughput data processing and AI tools to assess with a single tracer both perfusion and metabolism in preclinical and clinical models. In the long run, RETIMAGER’s faster, lower dose, and less invasive molecular imaging technology will become a game-changer for understanding disease processes by unveiling new accurate image-based quantitative biomarkers, taking scientific and healthcare stakeholders a step closer to personalized precision medicine.",101099096

IBSEN will provide a breakthrough by building a repertoire of human behaviour in large (1000+ persons) structured groups using controlled experiments. To that end, we will develop a novel setup for large groups of people that will provide an experimental protocol, the necessary software and analytical tools to allow us to deal with thousands of people at the same time. We will apply our setup to specific research questions, focusing on novel phenomenology that may arise in large systems as compared to typical smaller ones, to find the rules that govern human behaviour in those cases, including the influence of social context and individual identity on them. We will assess our approach by building a model of human interaction in groups based on the behavioural rules we have found. The project requires a high-degree of interdisciplinarity; accordingly, the team consists of physicists, economists, social psychologists, and computer scientists. On the other hand, this is a high-risk project, as the experimental design may prove unfeasible for really large systems and extracting meaningful data from the participants’ actions may not be possible. Notwithstanding, encouraging results in some pilot studies run by partners underpin the scientific feasibility of the concept and approach. If successful, researchers will be able to build on our findings to develop a human behaviour simulator, a technology providing a basis for socio-economic simulations that would radically change many fields, from robotics to economics, with technological and societal impacts, including policy-making in socially pressing issues.

Since electricity is generated until it reaches households, it passes through an average of four transformers. Currently the liquid used in most of these machines is a petroleum derivative, since its good performance is well known. However, the environmental awareness of many companies is demanding new transformers that are cooled by esters of natural origin. In this framework, BIOTRAFO proposes a study that allows to know the temperature in the windings of the transformer when using biodegradable liquids, which by their nature are more viscous. This temperature is a critical factor for the useful life of the transformer, due to the aging of dielectric solid materials. The aging of these materials when immersed in these liquids will also be analyzed. Not only the question will be observed from a theoretical perspective, industrial platforms will also be used to test the generated models.The results of the research will be disseminated among specialized and non-specialized audiences, considering the commercial exploitation of the results obtained.

Fingerprints are the oldest and the most reliable features to be used because of their singularity and inalterability. The main goal of the PYCSEL project is to develop a low cost thin and large area fingerprint sensing surface enabling the personal identification via the development of a TOLAE technology, combining an organic sensor with a TFT matrix on a plastic foil. Based on the fact that personal recognition requires high resolution (500 dpi) and large (1 up to 4 fingers) sensors, the project focuses on the design, development and integration of a printed pyroelectric PVDF-based sensor layer on a IGZO TFT active matrix on foil and connected to an electronic driver and readout board, resulting in a thin fingerprint conformable sensor with no need for any optical bulky and/or costly extra components integration. Multiple fingerprints capture will be possible with the resulting large area hybrid system whose conformability allow easy further integration and ergonomic use especially for high growth and high value portable security uses. Therefore, it will offer differentiating properties for the portable governmental market as it will exhibit breakthrough in terms of mechanical robustness and conformability. Those advantages will also increase fingerprint sensors penetration into high volume automotive (personalized HMIs), machine tool (user-restricted HMI), buildings (access control) and consumer markets (PCs). The PYCSEL project will also entitle a transfer from LAB proof of concept to Technological validation in relevant environment.

This political use of discussion apps has been hypothesized to generate hatred towards targeted social groups, support non-democratic tactics and values, and eventually lead to the election of politicians who rely on this tactic. In spite of alarming reports, little systematic knowledge exists about political actors’ reliance on discussion apps or about its effects. Since 2016, social media misinformation has provoked considerable attention in academia. This literature has however almost entirely overlooked discussion apps. This lack of scholarship is puzzling, insofar as discussion apps may constitute a greater menace than other services. Two distinctive technical features of WhatsApp – encryption and the necessary existence of pre-existing ties between group members – arguably make these apps efficient vehicle for political misinformation. Drawing on this intuition, I hypothesize that WhatsApp constitutes a preferential channel for the circulation of political misinformation; that features of WhatsApp communities make it more likely than misinformation will be believed, less likely that it will be corrected, and more likely that it will have an impact on users’ downstream attitudes. The project relies on qualitative and experimental methods to test hypotheses derived from this intuition in two large democracies in which political actors are widely hypothesized to use WhatsApp: India and Brazil. Relying on in-depth interviews, the project examines how and why party actors embrace the technology. Second, it relies on crowdsourcing to quantify misinformation on WhatsApp. Third, the project develops two types of experimental designs to examine the determinants of individual-level belief in misinformation. Finally, it relies on the same designs to analyze the effect of misinformation on the aforementioned attitudes.",101002985

This traffic type is foreseen to account for close to 90 percent of consumer traffic already by 2012. However, the current Internet, and in particular the mobile Internet, was not designed with video requirements in mind and, as a consequence, its architecture is very inefficient when handling video traffic. It is the vision of this consortium that, as video is going to represent the majority of the traffic, the future Internet architecture should be tailored to efficiently support the requirements of this traffic type. Specific enhancements for video should be introduced at all layers of the protocol stack where needed, ideally supporting an incremental deployment.Following the above vision, the main goal of the current proposal is to evolve the Internet architecture for efficient video traffic support. The proposed architecture will follow a cross-layer design that, by exploiting the interaction between layers, can raise performance to values unattainable with individual developments. The following key issues will be addressed by the architecture: i) enhanced wireless access support to optimise video performance, ii) novel IP mobility architecture adapted to the requirements of video traffic, iii) transport optimisations for video distribution and iv) network-aware video services that interact with the underlying layers. The technology developed by the project will be designed taking into account the requirements of network operators for commercial deployment, and will aim at improving the Quality of Experience by users as well as reducing the associated costs for operators.

New sensor-based and bodily sensory feedback devices, such as those brought by immersive virtual reality, allow creating Body Transformation Experiences (BTE). These perceptual illusions, like being in a child’s body, lead to experience changes in one’s own body. Beyond fun experiences, the new field of BTE engineering brings a significant leap for wellbeing and health applications, as well as for the embodiment of robotic devices and virtual avatars, and smart clothing. However, the neuroscience of core sensory-driven changes in Mental Body Representations (MBR) currently represents piecemeal experiments in very controlled settings that restrict body movement.

Two large-scale projects are OPENCOSS and SafeCer, which dealt with assurance and certification of software-intensive critical systems using incremental and model-based approaches. OPENCOSS defined a Common Certification Language (CCL), unifying concepts from different industries to build a harmonized approach to reduce time and cost overheads, via facilitating the reuse of certification assets. SafeCer developed safety-oriented process lines, a component model, contract-based verification techniques, and process/product-based model-driven safety certification for compositional development and certification of CPSs.AMASS will create and consolidate a de-facto European-wide assurance and certification open tool platform, ecosystem and self-sustainable community spanning the largest CPS vertical markets.

Scientifically, streaming online media pose new challenges, due to their shorter, noisier, and more colloquial nature. Moreover, they form a temporal stream strongly grounded in events and context. Consequently, existing language technologies fall short on accuracy, scalability and portability.The goal of this project is to deliver. innovative, portable open-source real-time methods for cross-lingual mining and summarisation of large-scale stream media.TrendMiner will achieve this through an inter-disciplinary approach, combining deep linguistic methods from text processing, knowledge-based reasoning from web science, machine learning, economics, and political science. No expensive human annotated data will be required due to our use of time-series data (e.g. financial markets, political polls) as a proxy. A key novelty will be weakly supervised machine learning algorithms for automatic discovery of new trends and correlations. Scalability and affordability will be addressed through a cloud-based infrastructure for real-time text mining from stream media.Results will be validated in two high-profile case studies: financial decision support (with analysts, traders, regulators, and economists) and political analysis and monitoring (with politicians, economists, and political journalists).The techniques will be generic with many business applications: business intelligence, customer relations management, community support.

It will be a permanent installation in large public buildings like railway stations but also a portable COUNTERFOG for use outdoors, used to counteract a CBRN attack in its earliest stages, greatly reducing the number of potential fatalities.  In fact, COUNTERFOG will use the same “weapon” as a CBRN attack: a dispersed state with a large surface/volume ratio. It will penetrate all the intricate holes CBRN agents are able to infiltrate. As it needs a minimum quantity of decontaminant, it is intrinsically an environmental-friendly and electric-compatible system. It would have three benefits: Firstly, to neutralize and collapse the CBRN cloud, secondly, to rapidly decontaminate all the affected people in that area, and finally, to rapidly decontaminate any equipment and the facility itself.Because of the large-scale fogging capacity of up to three components, choice of pressures and capability to simultaneously emulsify liquids and disperse solid particles and an enormous surface/volume ratio, it will be possible to counteract a CBRN cloud in large, open areas.  Nozzle, sensor and solid mesoporous particles will be technological keys.A Fog Dynamic Laboratory will be designed, built and used in the project to test the ability such a system has to condense different kinds of smokes, clouds or fogs and its ability to simultaneously neutralize different kinds of CBRN agents and combined incidents (fire & CBRN).

And yet the carbon emissions have not decreased but increased since 2006.  The present project presents a novel approach to achieve a global reduction of carbon emissions in the coming decades by harnessing the power of financial regulation. We will concentrate on the challenges to make this approach work, as well as on the opportunities it presents, to achieve a practical solution for this extremely difficult problem. We argue that financial stability regulation is sufficiently powerful to change the incentives for firms and reduce significantly their carbon footprints. The substance of the argument starts from the observation that financial systems are increasingly interconnected. This increasing interconnection has led regulators to give a larger role to a macroprudential  approach in their activities. That is, they intend to reduce risks to the whole financial system, what they call “systemic risks,” rather than simply risks to individual institutions. Our work stems from a large emerging literature about contagion in financial networks,  and will explore its implications for climate change mitigation and financial regulation. The substance of this project is to answer a series of questions about the viability and desirability of this policy. It will be structured around three work packages. WP1, will analyse the expected distribution of shocks that arises from climate change. It will also study their impact to the financial system. The other two works packages will explore two key determinants of adoption of the policy. In WP2 we explore the impact of the large uncertainty about the effects of climate change on the mindset of regulators. In WP3 we study the transmission of social attitudes and social norms into the decision processes of legislators and regulators.",891124

It is the vision of this consortium that, as video is going to represent the majority of the traffic, the future Internet architecture should be tailored to efficiently support the requirements of this traffic type. Specific enhancements for video should be introduced at all layers of the protocol stack where needed, ideally supporting an incremental deployment.Following the above vision, the main goal of the current proposal is to evolve the Internet architecture for efficient video traffic support. The proposed architecture will follow a cross-layer design that, by exploiting the interaction between layers, can raise performance to values unattainable with individual developments. The following key issues will be addressed by the architecture: i) enhanced wireless access support to optimise video performance, ii) novel IP mobility architecture adapted to the requirements of video traffic, iii) transport optimisations for video distribution and iv) network-aware video services that interact with the underlying layers. The technology developed by the project will be designed taking into account the requirements of network operators for commercial deployment, and will aim at improving the Quality of Experience by users as well as reducing the associated costs for operators.

Furthermore, so far photonic packaging considered the sub-GHz electrical connections to the PICs as a separate and second priority issue, until the number of electrical IOs of the PICs was too large to ignore. POLYNICES aims to address these challenges with the development of a novel general purpose photonic integration technology, compatible with wafer scale processes that will reduce the production costs of photonic modules by at least 10x. POLYNICES will develop for the first time a polymer based Electro-Optic PCB (EOPCB) motherboard that will host Si3N4 chiplets, InP components and micro-optical elements. POLYNICES invests in Si3N4 platform with PZT actuators to realize complex structures in only 1x1 cm2 chiplets with ultra-low power consumption.

The OR tools will encompass methods including morphological analysis, attack-defence trees, Bow-tie diagrams and wargaming. The tools have been well-established for decades and they will be further developed and adapted for explosive threats. The proposed research aims to assess the effectiveness of counter-tools and their combinations across the plot. This will give a value on the efficiency they can provide for historical cases or emerging and future scenarios for an attack. The project will strive to identify commonalities in the timeline where a counter-tool can be effective for several different scenarios. Thus, an effectiveness assessment will be made not only across the timeline for one scenario but also across different scenarios. The research and development efforts on a European level over the last decades will be a main source of background data.A gap analysis over the plot will in combination with the OR methods identify the need of required preventive counter-measures. A gap bridging assessment will together with the researcher and practitioner think-tank in ENTRAP ensure a step-change vision of counter-tools for important gaps. Historical attacks, scenarios defined in FP 7 projects, the EU Matrix group and NDE will be used as the basis. A cost assessment will be included giving an estimate for the required further developments.The ENTRAP consortium will bring together a world-leading team where the consortium includes 11 practitioners supported by an advisory board of key entities whereof 18 Letter of Supports have been obtained.",740560

This is envisioned by the means of an integrated and virtualised networking and computing solution where virtualised functions, context-aware services, and user and third-party applications are blended together to offer enhanced connectivity and better quality of experience. The proposed solution contemplates two major building blocks, namely (i) the Edge and Fog computing System (EFS) subsuming all the edge and fog computing substrate offered as a shared hosting environment for virtualised functions, services, and applications; and (ii) the Orchestration and Control System (OCS) responsible for managing and controlling the EFS, including its interworking with other (non-EFS) domains (e.g., transport and core networks, distant clouds, etc.). Through the 5G-CORAL solution, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can be achieved, notably an ultra-low end-to-end latency in the order of milliseconds. Moreover, new business prospects arise with new stakeholders in the value chain, notably small players owning computing and networking assets in the local service area, such as in shopping malls, airports, trains and cars.

The overall goal of START (a Stable and resilienT ATM by integrAting Robust airline operations into the neTwork) is to develop, implement, and validate optimisation algorithms for robust airline operations that result in stable and resilient ATM performance even in disturbed scenarios. START’s goal shall be reached by a suitable combination of methods from applied mathematics, i.e.: mathematical optimisation, optimisation under uncertainty, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science, as well as algorithm design. Furthermore, insight into the uncertainties relevant in TBO systems will be gained through simulations. The main focus of the project is the optimization of conventional traffic situations while considering disruptive weather events such as thunderstorms.  Specific goals include:1.To model uncertainties at the micro (trajectory) level, assimilate observations (via ADSB/Radar) every 15 min and propagate trajectory uncertainties using assimilated models and a stochastic trajectory predictor. 2.To model uncertainties at the macro (ATM network) level, assimilate observations (satellite data for storm, and network status) every 15 min., and propagate ATM network uncertainties using the assimilated models. 3.To develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm capable of generating a set of pan-European (i.e., considering the whole traffic over Europe) robust trajectories that make the European ATM system resilient when facing these relevant validate ties. 4.To implement those algorithms as an advanced fight dispatching demo functionality for airspace users to obtain robust trajectories.5.To validate these concepts through system-wide simulation procedures in order to evaluate their stability.",893204

MB expands the available capacity of optical fibres, by enabling transmission within S, E, and O bands, in addition to commercial C and/or C+L bands, which translates into a potential 10x capacity increase and low-latency for services beyond 5G. To realize multiband networks, technology advances are required, both in data, control and management planes. Concerning devices, these include new amplifiers, filterless subsystems, add/drop multiplexers, etc. Such technology advances complement novel packet-optical white boxes using flexible sliceable Bandwidth Variable Transceivers and novel pluggable optics. The availability of MB transmission will also lead to a complete redesign of the end-to-end architecture, removing boundaries between network domains and reducing electronic intermediate terminations. The control plane will be extended to support multiband elements and a ‘domain-less’ network architecture. It will rely on physical layer abstraction, new impairment modelling, and pervasive telemetry data collection to feed AI/ML algorithms that will lead to a Zero-Touch networking paradigm including a full featured node operating system for packet-optical whiteboxes. The results will be shown in two final demonstrations exposing the project benefits from operator and user perspectives.

Prime setback of reinforcement in concrete is corrosion. Corrosion of reinforcements often limits the durability of reinforced concrete structures. In fact, the high alkalinity of concrete creates an environment that protects steel against corrosion. However, the life expectancy of concrete structures is affected by corrosion of steel reinforcements, because of an aggressive attack of chloride ions or as a result of carbonation. Corrosion of reinforcement has huge economic implications as well as social issues including endangering the safety of people who are working in industries. Corrosion inhibitors are among the methods that can be taken into consideration to reduce the steel bar corrosion. Corrosion inhibitors have been reported to control the corrosion of steel reinforcements without significantly changing the concrete properties. The environmental toxicity of the synthesized corrosion inhibitors has resulted in the search for finding green corrosion inhibitors with lower amount of toxic compounds. Among various compounds the corrosion inhibitors extracted from the plant products are inexpensive, readily available and renewable. Most parts of plants such as leaf, fruits peel, etc., are rich of the compounds that give them the capability to be used as corrosion inhibitor for various substrates in different electrolytes. Although some reports can be found in the literature regarding the use of natural corrosion inhibitors in concrete, not so many data are available on taking advantage of the synergism between inorganic inhibitors and organic compounds extracting from plant products.

One of them is the data enhancement of experiments, since PINNs can reconstruct by means of applying the Navier-Stokes equations as loss function the full fluid domain in areas where experiments are limited by technology. On the other hand, the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as robust networks with excellent precision but excessive computational costs leaves the door open to further investigate new applications where PINNs and GANs can be combined to amplify their strengths and reduce their weak points. One of those applications regards the forecast of severe weather conditions, where PINNs are useful to compute the fluidic behavior of storms approaching a certain location, whereas GANs can incorporate many additional parameters, such as wind speed, humidity, temperature and electric content, which may be essential to determine if in the following 48h a certain location is going to suffer from severe weather conditions.

The present proposal has the goal of implementing the activities described in the Roadmap during Horizon Europe through a joint programme of the members of the EUROfusion Consortium, with the following high-level objectives: 1.Construct and commission ITER; 2.Secure the success of future ITER operation via preparation and experiments on present devices;3.Develop the conceptual design of a DEMO fusion power plant;4.Finalise the design and construct a fusion spectrum neutron source (IFMIF-DONES);5.Advance the stellarator as an alternative approach to fusion power plants;6.Prepare the ITER and DEMO generations of scientists, engineers and operators; 7.Promote innovation and European industry competitiveness in fusion technology and beyond.The ITER success remains an important overarching objective of the programme and much attention is devoted to ensure that ITER operation is properly prepared, and that a new generation of scientists and engineers is thoroughly educated and trained for its exploitation. DEMO is the only step between ITER and a commercial fusion power plant. To achieve the goal of fusion electricity demonstration in the early 2050-ies, the DEMO Conceptual Design has to be completed by 2030 at the latest, to allow the start of the Engineering Design Activities. DEMO cannot be defined and designed by research laboratories alone, but requires the full involvement of industry in all technological and systems aspects of the design. Therefore, specific provisions for the involvement of industry in the Consortium activities are envisaged.",101052200
act544503,EKSISTENZ: Harmonized framework allowing a sustainable and robust identity for European Citizens,2014.0,2017.0,EUROPEAN COMMISSION RESEARCH EXECUTIVE AGENCY,FP7-SEC-2013-607049,European Research Project,,"The increase of the identity theft phenomenon across Europe and its related human and economical impacts is a major concern for all M.S. Several EU initiatives are ongoing to try to curb this concern. Today’s identity can take various forms, either in the “real” world, as a primary identity delivered by a M.S. (passport, ID card, driving license...) but more and more in the “2.0” world (secondary identity for banking, administration, professional and commercial activities...). Similarly identity theft can take various forms, from stealing citizens' paper documents, or simply by using digital means. Privacy is at the center of all concerns, as any solution must protect citizen’s identity and privacy, whilst not being worse than the problem itself.The major objective of EKSISTENZ is to protect EU citizens’ identities from all current threats but also to foresee what the future threats would be. The project will study in deep the identity theft phenomenon in Europe, revealing the flaws in the different “paper-based” procedures but also in the new dematerialized processes, assess the threat for the citizen and consequently, will develop technological components, backward compatible with different existing M.S. frameworks. EKSISTENZ will also focus on an “identity-as-a-service” approach, to allow M.S. interoperability, leading to a more global system to provide secure and strong identity for all M.S.To achieve this, the consortium will bring together different types of users involved in the identity chain (authorities, industrials, stakeholders, businesses), specialized technology providers and of course, data protection and privacy experts. EKSISTENZ will recommend updates to EU regulations in order to clearly inform, protect, propose responses and increase its resilience following an attempt. Knowing this, identity theft will become, if not impossible, much harder to carry out.",607049
act561936,SEASON - SELF-MANAGED SUSTAINABLE HIGH-CAPACITY OPTICAL NETWORKS,2023.0,2025.0,EUROPEAN COMMISSION RESEARCH EXECUTIVE AGENCY,101096120,European Research Project,,"The goal of the SEASON project is to design and validate a sustainable transport network infrastructure able to support beyond 5G and new emerging services. The SEASON infrastructure will rely on the joint usage of Multi-Band (MB) and Space Division Multiplexing (SDM), spanning the access, aggregation, and metro/long-haul segments, supporting the requirements for x-haul, further integrating the packet/optical and computing layers, and targeting cost-effective capacity increase. A critical objective of such architecture is to ensure energy efficiency. SEASON will rely on power-efficient Digital Signal Processing (DSP), MBoverSDM optical switching, point-to-multipoint transceivers allowing traffic aggregation/router bypassing, and converged packet-optical solutions reducing the number of O/E/O conversions. Such complex infrastructure requires rethinking the control and orchestration systems towards autonomous optical networks, addressing not only the integration - in overarching control systems - of the Radio Access Network (RAN), access and transport segments but also adopting more agile DevOps methodologies. SEASON will leverage on cognitive networks powered by streaming telemetry, real-time network measurements and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-aided service management and orchestration for near-real time network operation, moving intelligence as close as possible to the data plane, and devising a distributed system based on multiple communicating agents and data-driven closed control loops. SEASON will have a clear impact on the society, in a context with increased needs of connectivity and higher capacity demand required for services such as VR/AR.The SEASON consortium includes major European telecom operators (Telefonica, TIM), major vendors (ADVA, Infinera P/G, Ericsson), three consolidated SMEs (Accelleran, Wings and WestAquila) and four top-reputed research centres and academia (CNIT, CTTC, Fraunhofer HHI, and UPC).",101096120
