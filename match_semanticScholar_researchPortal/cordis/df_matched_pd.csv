The tool would shed light on issues central to the energy transition’s success, making it precious for regulators, policymakers, energy-intensive consumers, and energy firms. In particular, the tool would be instrumental in informing the current policy debate on the electricity market reform. The tool would build on state-of-the-art game-theoretical models developed by the PI through her ERC Consolidator Grant ELECTRIC CHALLENGES, providing the basis to simulate firms’ competitive and strategic behavior in electricity markets with large shares of renewable energies and energy storage. Those models also serve to assess the low-carbon investments’ impact on several metrics reflecting electricity market outcomes (prices, market shares, emissions, etc.) and firms’ financial profitability (pay-back period, NPV, IRR, etc.) The algorithm would be programmed in Python, and an internet-based interface would be developed for ease of use. Data from the Spanish electricity market would be used to test the tool, which would be further extended to other European power markets. Relevant stakeholders in the sector have already shown their support and willingness to participate in the training and testing stages. The team comprises the PI (Natalia Fabra), postdocs at EnergyEcoLab (the research lab she created under her ERC grant), and software programmers who would carry out the programming activities. The team combines a deep knowledge of the power sector and the energy transition policies, a deep understanding of the relevant economic questions, and a deep command of the methods for modeling and quantifying the performance of electricity markets.","NextENERGEIA plans to develop and test a proof-of-concept prototype of an analytical tool for simulating the social and private impact on power markets of low-carbon investments (renewable energies, energy storage, electric vehicles, and hydrogen production).

Among the voices arguing most strongly for a change in the way that young macroeconomists are trained are those coming from employers in the private and public sector. Strikingly, many employers are also arguing that a knowledge of economic history might be particularly useful.  A knowledge of economic and financial history is crucial in thinking about macroeconomic problems and the financial sector in several ways. It forces students to recognize that major discontinuities in economic performance and economic policy regimes have occurred many times in the past, and may therefore occur again in the future. Additionally, economic history teaches students the importance of context. Finally, exposure to economic history leads to an empirical frame of mind, and a willingness to admit that one’s preferred theoretical framework may not always work in explaining the real world. These are essential habits for young economists wishing to apply their skills in the work environment. Young macroeconomists need training in economic and financial history. Equally, students of economic history need exposure to the techniques of modern macroeconomics and financial economics. MACROHIST brings together some of the strongest history, economic history and economics departments in Europe. Its aim is to expose young macroeconomists to the most recent work in macroeconomic and financial history; young economic historians to the most recent techniques in financial and macroeconomics, and both groups to the policy and work environment. We will achieve these aims by funding research on macroeconomics and macroeconomic and financial history; by funding visiting studentships for ESRs in partner institutions; by organising internships and other activities with our private sector partners; and by arranging network-wide research and training events.","The current macroeconomic and financial crisis has given rise to a vigorous debate about the state of macroeconomics and macroeconomic training.

It enables spacecraft to de-orbit and/or re-boost without the need for consumables. It interacts passively with its environment (ambient plasma, magnetic field and solar radiation) to exchange momentum with the planet’s magnetosphere. E.T.PACK aims at developing a proof of concept for LWTs by breaking through and combining the current frontier of knowledge in three fields: plasma physics, low work function material science and space tethers. These will be integrated into a deorbit kit and a flight simulator for mission analysis. The kit aims to reach Technology Readiness Level 4 and will have two modes of operation: as a fully passive LWT and as a conventional electrodynamic tether equipped with an active hollow-cathode (backup mode). A new coating process for the electride, C12A7 ([Ca24Al28O64]4+(4e-)), will be developed, and used to manufacture a LWT demonstrator. The C12A7 and its extraordinary properties will be also applied to the hollow cathode of the kit, which will include a novel deployment mechanism specifically designed for LWT applications. The complex current exchange of LWTs with the ambient plasma under space-charge-conditions will be studied theoretically, and used to develop accurate simulators. The theory-experiment comparisons will lead to a solid framework for LWT operation and constraints, including thermal, mechanical, optical, electrical, ATOX and UV resistance, and survivability.

It enables spacecraft to de-orbit and/or re-boost without the need for consumables. It interacts passively with its environment (ambient plasma, magnetic field and solar radiation) to exchange momentum with the planet’s magnetosphere. E.T.PACK aims at developing a proof of concept for LWTs by breaking through and combining the current frontier of knowledge in three fields: plasma physics, low work function material science and space tethers. These will be integrated into a deorbit kit and a flight simulator for mission analysis. The kit aims to reach Technology Readiness Level 4 and will have two modes of operation: as a fully passive LWT and as a conventional electrodynamic tether equipped with an active hollow-cathode (backup mode). A new coating process for the electride, C12A7 ([Ca24Al28O64]4+(4e-)), will be developed, and used to manufacture a LWT demonstrator. The C12A7 and its extraordinary properties will be also applied to the hollow cathode of the kit, which will include a novel deployment mechanism specifically designed for LWT applications. The complex current exchange of LWTs with the ambient plasma under space-charge-conditions will be studied theoretically, and used to develop accurate simulators. The theory-experiment comparisons will lead to a solid framework for LWT operation and constraints, including thermal, mechanical, optical, electrical, ATOX and UV resistance, and survivability. Hitherto impossible mission scenarios will be explored, thus opening up new horizons in space science and technology.

Besides, several exploration and scientific missions, such as Mars Sample Return, contemplate high power electric propulsion as the main propulsion system.Despite these potential advantages, several factors have limited the possibility of reaching qualified status for these systems, such as huge costs and availability of test facility. ASPIRE aims to increase the TRL of 20kW Hall Thruster system up to 6 by exploiting results obtained within CHEOPS. The project will cover many aspects, from mission scenarios analysis and satellite architecture consolidation to thruster unit TRL raise to 7 and enabling reduced-cost qualification. To keep operational and development costs as low as possible, krypton is maintained as baseline propellant.The ASPIRE project also aims at augmenting the numerical modelling capability necessary for qualification of high-power EP systems, which lacks in Europe. The numerical models, developed and refined by three academic partners in the frame of this project, will be validated with the data gathered in more than 1000 hours of firing with Kr.

This points to a significant need for innovation in healthcare indoor environments to tackle the challenge of infectioncontrol, while improving thermal comfort and energy efficiency in hospitals. To achieve this, we must both advance the fundamental understanding of how people are exposed to airborne pathogens and develop new tools and techniques to enable effective design and operation of healthcare environments. Specifically, there is a need to understand better the local influence of airflows on particles in HCC; quantify the transient behaviour of airflows and contaminants due to healthcare activities like surgery; develop methods for optimising and adapting ventilation systems to control for risks in different environments like operation rooms and isolation rooms; and develop tools to enable real-time interaction with environments during design and operational phases.

This points to a significant need for innovation in healthcare indoor environments to tackle the challenge of infectioncontrol, while improving thermal comfort and energy efficiency in hospitals. To achieve this, we must both advance the fundamental understanding of how people are exposed to airborne pathogens and develop new tools and techniques to enable effective design and operation of healthcare environments. Specifically, there is a need to understand better the local influence of airflows on particles in HCC; quantify the transient behaviour of airflows and contaminants due to healthcare activities like surgery; develop methods for optimising and adapting ventilation systems to control for risks in different environments like operation rooms and isolation rooms; and develop tools to enable real-time interaction with environments during design and operational phases. Bringing together 8 leading academic teams, 4 healthcare facilities and 8 HVAC industry partners, the HumanIC network aims to build a new approach to hospital environmental design through the concept of HCC and the training of 15 Early Career Stage Researchers to address these needs. HumanIC will create and disseminate fundamental and applied science to improve the knowledge base and innovate new technologies for designing and operating hospital ventilation and thermal systems and for reducing infection risk by at least 30%, meanwhile satisfying requirements of thermal comfort, safety and energy."

The project proposes the integration of heterogeneous wireless technologies in a multi-hop fashion to provide scalable and efficient ubiquitous quad-play carrier services.<br/><br/>To address the integration complexity of heterogeneous radio technologies, CARMEN introduces a layer 2.5 located between the subnet layer and the routing layer, in order to abstract technology specific issues into a common set of events and commands.

For each canonical problem, I will investigate traditionally-machined and 3D-printed specimens manufactured with 4 different engineering metals widely used in aerospace and civilian-security applications. The goal is to elucidate whether at sufficiently high strain rates there may be a transition in the fragmentation mechanisms from defects–controlled to inertia–controlled. If the new statistical-deterministic framework is proven to be valid, defects may not play the major role in the fragmentation at high strain rates. This would bring down the entry barriers that the 3D-printing technology has found in energy absorption applications, thus reducing production transportation and repairing, energetic and economic costs of protective structures without impairing their energy absorption capacity.It is anticipated that leading this cutting-edge research project will enable me to establish my own research team and help me to achieve career independence in the field of dynamic behaviour of ductile solids.","Dynamic fragmentation of metals is typically addressed within a statistical framework in which material and geometric flaws limit the energy absorption capacity of protective structures.

However, when it refers to the imminent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)’s application, MEnts are the most vulnerable due to their lack of expertise and resources to invest in their adoption. It is urgent to develop solutions that assist MEnts in smoothly adopting the GDPR, safeguarding the interests of the EU citizens on data privacy and security, avoiding the negative socioeconomic consequences entailed to breaches for MEnts, and, by extension, benefitting the European society. SMOOTH project addresses this challenge from two complementary focuses:1) Creating awareness on the importance of being compliant with the GDPR, as many MEnts ignore their obligations in this respect, involving as partners Data Protection Authorities and associations representing EU MEnts. For the same purpose, SMOOTH will deliver a practical GDPR interactive handbook (website and mobile app) tailored specifically to MEnts. 2) Assisting MEnts to effectively adopt and comply with the GDPR. The SMOOTH cloud platform will use machine learning, text and data mining, and advance online auditing methods to automatically create a bespoke GDPR compliance report for the most critical aspects to MEnts. Likewise, SMOOTH will provide useful materials for solving those identified aspects of the GDPR that are not properly covered.  All this will positively contribute to citizens rights, while avoiding potential fines for the MEnts that may account for as much as 4% of the annual income, according to the GDPR. SMOOTH is born from technology partners and data protection authorities and will be designed and validated by actual MEnts with the aim of becoming the reference tool platform for them to adopt the GDPR.","According to the last official available 2015 data, almost 93% of all enterprises in Europe in the non-financial business sector have less than 10 employees.

However, when it refers to the imminent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)’s application, MEnts are the most vulnerable due to their lack of expertise and resources to invest in their adoption. It is urgent to develop solutions that assist MEnts in smoothly adopting the GDPR, safeguarding the interests of the EU citizens on data privacy and security, avoiding the negative socioeconomic consequences entailed to breaches for MEnts, and, by extension, benefitting the European society. SMOOTH project addresses this challenge from two complementary focuses:1) Creating awareness on the importance of being compliant with the GDPR, as many MEnts ignore their obligations in this respect, involving as partners Data Protection Authorities and associations representing EU MEnts. For the same purpose, SMOOTH will deliver a practical GDPR interactive handbook (website and mobile app) tailored specifically to MEnts. 2) Assisting MEnts to effectively adopt and comply with the GDPR. The SMOOTH cloud platform will use machine learning, text and data mining, and advance online auditing methods to automatically create a bespoke GDPR compliance report for the most critical aspects to MEnts. Likewise, SMOOTH will provide useful materials for solving those identified aspects of the GDPR that are not properly covered.  All this will positively contribute to citizens rights, while avoiding potential fines for the MEnts that may account for as much as 4% of the annual income, according to the GDPR. SMOOTH is born from technology partners and data protection authorities and will be designed and validated by actual MEnts with the aim of becoming the reference tool platform for them to adopt the GDPR."

The carrier frequency will result from beating two optical modes from dual mode laser on a high speed photodiode with an integrated antenna. The technical challenge that iPHOS is going to address is the integration of all of these elements on a single chip, including dual-wavelength sources, passive waveguide for optical couplers and connecting waveguides, electro-optical modulators for data encoding and high speed photodiode for electro-optical conversion. This challenge will require a strong effort on chip integration. In addition, advanced packaging technology will contribute to the goal of providing a compact and rugged system.The first application field targeted by iPHOS are future on-board flight entertainment systems, effort led by partner THALES.

This interdisciplinary and intersectoral project explores the gender bias within the Spanish telecommunications industry as a direct consequence of the lack of women in the sector. The purpose is to develop a multi-methodological study that allows to draw attention and evidence the gender gap and the consequent lack of a gender perspective within this industry in Spain. The central hypothesis is that the current gender gap in the sector leads to lack of integration of a gender perspective leading consequently, to the reproduction of gender bias in AI technologies. This, as a result, produces a setback in gender equality. To explore this, the study asks the following questions: what is the degree of the gender gap within the telecommunications industry in Spain? Are measures being taken to address this? To answer these questions, I will gather data on two levels: first, at the general level by implementing a quantitative survey-based methodology, targeting 400 industry insiders to gain information on the gender gap in the overall sector; and second, at the specific level, by carrying out a case-study through my secondment at Telefónica, Investigación y Desarrollo (TID), a Spanish leading research centre in new technologies where I will use qualitative-based methodologies to investigate its gender bias and its lack of integration of a gender perspective. A major outcome of this research is the production of a report to be handed to TID with specific guidelines for the incorporation of a gender perspective that will help them reduce their gender bias in their AI technologies and improve the commercialisation of their products. This report will have the potentiality of becoming a benchmark study for further research in the field, particularly within the European context.","The rise of algorithm-powered technology in the telecommunications industry has been criticised for reproducing gender bias, particularly in Artificial Intelligence-driven (AI) products. This interdisciplinary and intersectoral project explores the gender bias within the Spanish telecommunications industry as a direct consequence of the lack of women in the sector. The purpose is to develop a multi-methodological study that allows to draw attention and evidence the gender gap and the consequent lack of a gender perspective within this industry in Spain. The central hypothesis is that the current gender gap in the sector leads to lack of integration of a gender perspective leading consequently, to the reproduction of gender bias in AI technologies. This, as a result, produces a setback in gender equality.

It shall possess multi-functionality that will comprise thermal barrier effect, oxidation and corrosion protection, lotus effect, electrical insulation at elevated temperatures and fire protection.   The concept of the novel approach to protection of surfaces is a coating consisting in its initial state of nano- and/or micro-scaled metal particles with a defined size, deposited by spraying, brushing, dipping or sol-gel. During the heat treatment, the binder is expelled, bonding to the substrate surface achieved, the metallic particles sinter and oxidise completely resulting in hollow oxide spheres that form a quasi-foam structure. Simultaneously, a diffusion layer is formed below the coating serving as a corrosion protection layer and as a bond coat for the top layer. The structure of the coating system shall be adjusted by parameters like selection of source metal/alloy, particle size, substrate, binder and a defined heat treatment. For fire protection the formation of hollow oxide spheres will be processed in a separate step before deposition.  The flexibility of the new coatings integrates a wide field of application areas, such as gas and steam turbines in electric power generation and aero-engines, combustion chambers, boilers, steam generators and super-heaters, waste incineration, fire protection of composite materials in construction as well as reactors in chemical and petrochemical industry. A broad impact will thus be ensured increasing safety and the durability of components by an economic, multifunctional and flexible protection of their surfaces.

Nevertheless, EPT development is currently stuck due to the incomplete understanding of their physics, in particular electromagnetic (EM) plasma heating and anomalous transport. Additionally, the cylindrical geometry of existing EPT designs has inherent issues, with high plasma losses and erosion at the rear wall of the ionization chamber and a wide divergence of the generated plasma jet. ZARATHUSTRA aims to unravel the physical underpinnings of EPTs and revolutionize their design by accomplishing three objectives: (1) establish the first self-consistent model of EM plasma heating in these devices; (2) elucidate the role of plasma turbulence, wall interactions, and applied EM fields on anomalous transport and devise control solutions to minimize plasma losses; and (3) assess the feasibility and advantages of a disruptive non-cylindrical EPT concept. This will be made possible thanks to a unique multidisciplinary methodology based on: a ground-breaking two-level numerical simulation strategy with a novel electromagnetic-kinetic algorithm; state-of-the-art experimental measurements; advanced data analysis techniques; and thruster bread-board prototype development. As a result, the first complete theory of EM heating and anomalous transport in EPTs will be formulated, and the path will be paved for the development of a new generation of plasma thrusters with unsurpassed characteristics and performances. While the high ambition of the project represents high risk, this is more than compensated by the potential high gain: uncovering the physical mechanisms of EPTs, unblocking their progress, and claiming for Europe a privileged leadership position in this strategic field.","Electrodeless Plasma Thrusters (EPTs) are a new type of space propulsion that promises to overcome the limitations of traditional electric propulsion technologies and to offer unparalleled advantages in terms of power scaling, throttling range, lifetime, propellant types, and simplicity.

ZARATHUSTRA aims to unravel the physical underpinnings of EPTs and revolutionize their design by accomplishing three objectives: (1) establish the first self-consistent model of EM plasma heating in these devices; (2) elucidate the role of plasma turbulence, wall interactions, and applied EM fields on anomalous transport and devise control solutions to minimize plasma losses; and (3) assess the feasibility and advantages of a disruptive non-cylindrical EPT concept. This will be made possible thanks to a unique multidisciplinary methodology based on: a ground-breaking two-level numerical simulation strategy with a novel electromagnetic-kinetic algorithm; state-of-the-art experimental measurements; advanced data analysis techniques; and thruster bread-board prototype development. As a result, the first complete theory of EM heating and anomalous transport in EPTs will be formulated, and the path will be paved for the development of a new generation of plasma thrusters with unsurpassed characteristics and performances. While the high ambition of the project represents high risk, this is more than compensated by the potential high gain: uncovering the physical mechanisms of EPTs, unblocking their progress, and claiming for Europe a privileged leadership position in this strategic field."

Opera was invented to recover the power of Ancient music to move the human heart, and its history is a permanent exploration of the capacity of action, words and music to convey emotions. In the eighteenth century a new type of opera consolidated with the chief concern of expressing the character’s emotions as they changed throughout the drama, inspired by Descartes’ theory of human passions. The key expressive medium was the aria col da capo, where a single, distinct passion was represented, like a concentrated pill of emotional meaning. The ideal corpus to study this issue are the 900 operas set to music by 300 composers on the 27 dramas by Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782). It contains a comprehensive catalogue of emotions in music, a unique window of opportunity to scrutinize conventions that defined music expression and meaning for over a century, paving the way for the emergence of ‘absolute’ instrumental music, autonomous from any other art form.DIDONE presents an innovative approach to unveil these conventions: the creation of a corpus of 4,000 digitized arias from 200 opera scores based on Metastasio’s eight most popular dramas, to be analysed using traditional methods and big data computer technology. The comparative scrutiny of dozens of different musical settings of the same librettos will reveal how composers correlate specific dramatic circumstances and emotions with distinct poetic and musical features. The results will be applicable to three main fields: (i) opera performance; (ii) analysis and interpretation of other types of music; and (iii) composition in several scenarios, from film soundtracks to creation by Artificial Intelligence. An opera festival will be designed to recover and disseminate this hitherto ignored repertoire, which was essential to define the European musical identity.","The belief that ‘the end of music is to move human affections’ (Descartes, Compendium musicae) has been a central issue in European musical thought since Plato.

Completeness implies aiming to pursue a complete flow description, i.e. a time-resolved 3D characterization of velocity and thermodynamic variables. This will be achieved through a technique-integration approach based on data-driven methods. This grounds its basis on the principle that the superposed application of techniques is superior to their separate use. Compactness is pursued by exploring solutions with minimum technological complexity, and on developing new data output formats that are directly aimed at flow control applications. Key enablers for this task are (i) the novel concepts I recently proposed on data-driven techniques integration, (ii) the deep embedding of compressed-sensing methods in the data processing and (iii) the data-driven discovery of simplified governing equations of the dynamics.

RefMap investigates how the aviation business models will be affected by the availability of environmental data for each type and route of air vehicle, as this will enable stricter evidence-based Green policy making in the sector. This will be achieved via the development of the RefMap analytics platform processing environmental and weather data such as wind, noise, CO2 and non-CO2 emissions for both U-space and ATM.

RefMap investigates how the aviation business models will be affected by the availability of environmental data for each type and route of air vehicle, as this will enable stricter evidence-based Green policy making in the sector. This will be achieved via the development of the RefMap analytics platform processing environmental and weather data such as wind, noise, CO2 and non-CO2 emissions for both U-space and ATM.

However, the flat storage hierarchies found in classic HPC architectures no longer satisfy the performance requirements of data-processing applications. Uncoordinated file access in combination with limited bandwidth make the centralised back-end parallel file system a serious bottleneck. At the same time, emerging multi-tier storage hierarchies come with the potential to remove this barrier. But maximising performance still requires careful control to avoid congestion and balance computational with storage performance. Unfortunately, appropriate interfaces and policies for managing such an enhanced I/O stack are still lacking.The main objective of the ADMIRE project is to establish this control by creating an active I/O stack that dynamically adjusts computation and storage requirements through intelligent global coordination, malleability of computation and I/O, and the scheduling of storage resources along all levels of the storage hierarchy. To achieve this, we will develop a software-defined framework based on the principles of scalable monitoring and control, separated control and data paths, and the orchestration of key system components and applications through embedded control points. Our software-only solution will allow the throughput of HPC systems and the performance of individual applications to be substantially increased – and consequently energy consumption to be decreased – by taking advantage of fast and power-efficient node-local storage tiers using novel, European ad-hoc storage systems and in-transit/in-situ processing facilities. Furthermore, our enhanced I/O stack will offer quality-of-service (QoS) and resilience.  An integrated and operational prototype will be validated with several use cases from various domains, including climate/weather, life sciences, physics, remote sensing, and deep learning.","The growing need to process extremely large data sets is one of the main drivers for building exascale HPC systems today.

Here we propose a novel multidisciplinary path to solving this basic scientific question (the code), and in doing so generate a solution to the technical limitation (controlled odor emission).

Thus, we will have in hand an artificial odorant that is remotely switchable.

The Carleton lab will use imaging in order to investigate the patterns of neural activity induced by these artificial odorants in rodents. The Sobel lab will apply these artificial odorants to the human olfactory system, and measure perception and neural activity following switching the artificial smell on and off. Finally, given a potential role for olfactory receptors in skin, the Del Rio lab will test the efficacy of these artificial odorants in promoting wound healing. At the basic science level, this approach may allow solving the combinatorial code of olfaction.

Two different types of impactor will be considered from the engine failure, a metallic fragment (which will be related to an engine core part) and a composite fragment (which represents the failure of the blade).There are two overarching objectives in this project. The first one is to validate the maturity level of different technologies and structural solutions, to protect the rear-end structure from different impacts associated to engine failure. To this end both real and virtual impact tests of debris associated with the open rotor engine failure will be performed. The second objective of this project is to advance in the development of virtual testing methodologies. The economic impact of performing real experimental tests for the aircraft companies is very high, and virtual testing could diminish the number of experimental tests (and hence their economic impact).Both numerical and experimental approaches will be taken into account. Experimental tests will be performed by means of a pneumatic launcher, in order to achieve the impact velocities representatives of such event; high speed cameras, strain gauges, and 3D digital image correlation will be used to obtain the maximum quantity of data from the tests. Once impacted, non-destructive techniques will be used to determine the type and extension of the damage. Numerical simulations of the impact process will be also performed; a complete numerical methodology will be developed in order to appropriately model the phenomenon. After validation with the experimental tests, the numerical model will be used to perform parametric studies.","This project focus on the analysis of different shielding configurations to protect a rear-end structure of an open rotor aircraft from an engine failure.

This is crucial to obtain certification of aeronautical structures like those proposed within the “Clean Sky - Green Regional Aircraft” initiative.Current numerical models are based on tests and technologies developed during the nineties in European R&T Programs. Since then, significant progress has been achieved in the development of physically-based models and multiscale modelling strategies, which provide more accurate results and can be applied to different materials. In the CRASHING project, the state-of-the-art in multiscale simulation of composites will be transferred to the current numerical tools used by the industry in the simulation of the mechanical behaviour of composite structures for aerospace applications. The project will be focused in composite materials currently used in aircraft innovative designs. In addition, new materials with potential application in the future will be assessed with respect to the database generated along the project.The objective of CRASHING project is to develop multi-scale model approach that takes into account the physical mechanisms of damage at the different length scales so the influence of the microstructure and loading conditions can be taken into account rigorously. The multiscale approach describes systematically the material behaviour at different length scales from ply, laminate to component levels. Final models of the multi-scale approach will be suitable for simulations of aircraft crash-landing, ditching, bird strike, ice impacts and, in general, situations where the aircraft is subject to high frequency dynamic loads phenomena.","The use of composite materials as principal structural elements in an aircraft requires the complete understanding of their mechanical properties.

Profiling involves characterisation and ranking molecules in preclinical studies comprising in vitro drug combination assays, hollow fiber and single cell analysis, innovative murine and non-human primate models, PK/PD studies, combined with biomarker discovery and non-invasive NIR or PET/CT imaging to monitor disease progression and response to treatment.Modelling, simulation and artificial intelligence tools will help progress compounds from early preclinical to clinical development and to predict drug exposure, human doses and the best combinations.

The expected outcome of ERA4TB is a series of highly active, bactericidal, orally available drugs to constitute two or more new combination regimens with treatment-shortening potential ready for Phase II clinical evaluation. These regimens will be compatible with drugs used to treat common comorbidities, such as HIV-AIDS and diabetes, and should impact UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, namely, ending TB by 2030.","The European Regimen Accelerator for Tuberculosis (ERA4TB) has the explicit goal of developing a new combination therapy to treat all forms of TB starting from ~20 leads and drug candidates provided by EFPIA.

The interest of the topic relies in the fact that advances in semiconductor technology, favourable spectrum policy and demand for gigabit throughput capabilities have created an opportunity for millimetre wave radio technology above 100GHz. The iPHOS research plan aims to address what has been identified as the ""Achilles heel"" of systems operating in this frequency range: the lack of reliable, compact low cost sources which can give rise to commercially successful products.We propose optical techniques to generate the carrier wave, enabling us to integrate a high level of functionality such as tunability of the carrier wave and modulation to superimpose data. The carrier frequency will result from beating two optical modes from dual mode laser on a high speed photodiode with an integrated antenna. The technical challenge that iPHOS is going to address is the integration of all of these elements on a single chip, including dual-wavelength sources, passive waveguide for optical couplers and connecting waveguides, electro-optical modulators for data encoding and high speed photodiode for electro-optical conversion. This challenge will require a strong effort on chip integration. In addition, advanced packaging technology will contribute to the goal of providing a compact and rugged system.The first application field targeted by iPHOS are future on-board flight entertainment systems, effort led by partner THALES.

An important emerging area among MTC systems is that of low-latency communications, which targets systems that require reliable real-time communication with stringent requirements on latency and reliability.The design of low-latency wireless communication systems is a great challenge, since it requires a fundamentally different design approach than the one used in current high-rate systems. Indeed, current systems exchange packets of several thousand bits.

Consequently, the design of current systems is supported by the extensive information-theoretical knowledge we have about wireless communications. In contrast, low-latency systems exchange packets of only several hundred bits, so the rate of the error-correcting code must be significantly below the capacity to achieve the desired reliability. Consequently, for such systems, capacity is not a relevant performance measure, and design guidelines that are based on its behavior will be misleading.Currently, we are lacking the theoretical understanding of low-latency wireless communication systems that would be crucial to design them optimally.

However, there is huge room for improvement, as current clinical PET scanners are limited to spatial resolutions higher than 2.5 mm and temporal resolutions longer than 5 seconds. This hampers applications of PET for preclinical research and clinical diagnosis in small tissues or lesions and precludes real-time reconstruction of metabolic images. RETIMAGER is a proposal for a molecular imaging system with a ten-fold spatial and temporal improvement on the reconstructed image with respect to current PET devices. This will not only boost the quantitative performance, but it will enable new applications in cardiology, vascular oncology, oncology, neurology, and other areas. We will achieve this milestone by developing smart radiation detectors with non-conventional geometries that combine the advantages of both pixelated and monolithic detectors, the two dominant and seemingly incompatible technologies employed in PET scanners. Our new scanner will provide 0.25 mm pixel resolvability with time frames as short as 0.01 sec. By aggregating these blocks in a unique gantry self-adapting to the geometry of the field-of-view, RETIMAGER will achieve an unprecedented increase in sensitivity and in in vivo real-time imaging with submillimeter resolution. We will pair it with high-throughput data processing and AI tools to assess with a single tracer both perfusion and metabolism in preclinical and clinical models. In the long run, RETIMAGER’s faster, lower dose, and less invasive molecular imaging technology will become a game-changer for understanding disease processes by unveiling new accurate image-based quantitative biomarkers, taking scientific and healthcare stakeholders a step closer to personalized precision medicine.","Over the last decades, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been firmly established as the predominant molecular imaging technique due to its unmatched sensitivity and capability to address many different metabolic processes.

Based on the fact that personal recognition requires high resolution (500 dpi) and large (1 up to 4 fingers) sensors, the project focuses on the design, development and integration of a printed pyroelectric PVDF-based sensor layer on a IGZO TFT active matrix on foil and connected to an electronic driver and readout board, resulting in a thin fingerprint conformable sensor with no need for any optical bulky and/or costly extra components integration. Multiple fingerprints capture will be possible with the resulting large area hybrid system whose conformability allow easy further integration and ergonomic use especially for high growth and high value portable security uses.

This political use of discussion apps has been hypothesized to generate hatred towards targeted social groups, support non-democratic tactics and values, and eventually lead to the election of politicians who rely on this tactic. In spite of alarming reports, little systematic knowledge exists about political actors’ reliance on discussion apps or about its effects. Since 2016, social media misinformation has provoked considerable attention in academia. This literature has however almost entirely overlooked discussion apps. This lack of scholarship is puzzling, insofar as discussion apps may constitute a greater menace than other services. Two distinctive technical features of WhatsApp – encryption and the necessary existence of pre-existing ties between group members – arguably make these apps efficient vehicle for political misinformation. Drawing on this intuition, I hypothesize that WhatsApp constitutes a preferential channel for the circulation of political misinformation; that features of WhatsApp communities make it more likely than misinformation will be believed, less likely that it will be corrected, and more likely that it will have an impact on users’ downstream attitudes. The project relies on qualitative and experimental methods to test hypotheses derived from this intuition in two large democracies in which political actors are widely hypothesized to use WhatsApp: India and Brazil. Relying on in-depth interviews, the project examines how and why party actors embrace the technology. Second, it relies on crowdsourcing to quantify misinformation on WhatsApp. Third, the project develops two types of experimental designs to examine the determinants of individual-level belief in misinformation. Finally, it relies on the same designs to analyze the effect of misinformation on the aforementioned attitudes.","In many developing countries, political actors make extensive use of discussion apps such as WhatsApp to diffuse misinformation. This political use of discussion apps has been hypothesized to generate hatred towards targeted social groups, support non-democratic tactics and values, and eventually lead to the election of politicians who rely on this tactic. In spite of alarming reports, little systematic knowledge exists about political actors’ reliance on discussion apps or about its effects. Since 2016, social media misinformation has provoked considerable attention in academia. This literature has however almost entirely overlooked discussion apps. This lack of scholarship is puzzling, insofar as discussion apps may constitute a greater menace than other services.

However, the current Internet, and in particular the mobile Internet, was not designed with video requirements in mind and, as a consequence, its architecture is very inefficient when handling video traffic. It is the vision of this consortium that, as video is going to represent the majority of the traffic, the future Internet architecture should be tailored to efficiently support the requirements of this traffic type. Specific enhancements for video should be introduced at all layers of the protocol stack where needed, ideally supporting an incremental deployment.Following the above vision, the main goal of the current proposal is to evolve the Internet architecture for efficient video traffic support. The proposed architecture will follow a cross-layer design that, by exploiting the interaction between layers, can raise performance to values unattainable with individual developments. The following key issues will be addressed by the architecture: i) enhanced wireless access support to optimise video performance, ii) novel IP mobility architecture adapted to the requirements of video traffic, iii) transport optimisations for video distribution and iv) network-aware video services that interact with the underlying layers. The technology developed by the project will be designed taking into account the requirements of network operators for commercial deployment, and will aim at improving the Quality of Experience by users as well as reducing the associated costs for operators.

It is the vision of this consortium that, as video is going to represent the majority of the traffic, the future Internet architecture should be tailored to efficiently support the requirements of this traffic type. Specific enhancements for video should be introduced at all layers of the protocol stack where needed, ideally supporting an incremental deployment.Following the above vision, the main goal of the current proposal is to evolve the Internet architecture for efficient video traffic support. The proposed architecture will follow a cross-layer design that, by exploiting the interaction between layers, can raise performance to values unattainable with individual developments. The following key issues will be addressed by the architecture: i) enhanced wireless access support to optimise video performance, ii) novel IP mobility architecture adapted to the requirements of video traffic, iii) transport optimisations for video distribution and iv) network-aware video services that interact with the underlying layers. The technology developed by the project will be designed taking into account the requirements of network operators for commercial deployment, and will aim at improving the Quality of Experience by users as well as reducing the associated costs for operators.

This is embodied in the Unmanned Traffic Management Systems (UTM) that, in contrast to EU strategy, are one of the NASA’s main research priorities, whose objective is to create flight control centres for auto-piloted drones.Aligned with this, LABYRINTH aims to use this new approach to create a U-SPACE-based technology to make a leap forward in the efforts undertaken so far through the development of autonomous drone applications, focussing on solutions adressed to enhace safety and efficiency of civil trasnport in road, seaport and airport scenarios, including emergency assistance operations."

Prime setback of reinforcement in concrete is corrosion. Corrosion of reinforcements often limits the durability of reinforced concrete structures. In fact, the high alkalinity of concrete creates an environment that protects steel against corrosion. However, the life expectancy of concrete structures is affected by corrosion of steel reinforcements, because of an aggressive attack of chloride ions or as a result of carbonation. Corrosion of reinforcement has huge economic implications as well as social issues including endangering the safety of people who are working in industries. Corrosion inhibitors are among the methods that can be taken into consideration to reduce the steel bar corrosion. Corrosion inhibitors have been reported to control the corrosion of steel reinforcements without significantly changing the concrete properties. The environmental toxicity of the synthesized corrosion inhibitors has resulted in the search for finding green corrosion inhibitors with lower amount of toxic compounds. Among various compounds the corrosion inhibitors extracted from the plant products are inexpensive, readily available and renewable. Most parts of plants such as leaf, fruits peel, etc., are rich of the compounds that give them the capability to be used as corrosion inhibitor for various substrates in different electrolytes.

Accordingly, this study aims to examine the synergistic effect of some plant extracts and common inorganic inhibitors to The inhibition synergism of some plant extracts and common inorganic inhibitors to enhance the corrosion control of the embedding steel bars in concrete","Concrete structures are often strengthened by embedding steel ribs which is known as reinforcement in concrete. Prime setback of reinforcement in concrete is corrosion. Corrosion of reinforcements often limits the durability of reinforced concrete structures. In fact, the high alkalinity of concrete creates an environment that protects steel against corrosion. However, the life expectancy of concrete structures is affected by corrosion of steel reinforcements, because of an aggressive attack of chloride ions or as a result of carbonation. Corrosion of reinforcement has huge economic implications as well as social issues including endangering the safety of people who are working in industries. Corrosion inhibitors are among the methods that can be taken into consideration to reduce the steel bar corrosion. Corrosion inhibitors have been reported to control the corrosion of steel reinforcements without significantly changing the concrete properties. The environmental toxicity of the synthesized corrosion inhibitors has resulted in the search for finding green corrosion inhibitors with lower amount of toxic compounds.

One of them is the data enhancement of experiments, since PINNs can reconstruct by means of applying the Navier-Stokes equations as loss function the full fluid domain in areas where experiments are limited by technology. On the other hand, the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as robust networks with excellent precision but excessive computational costs leaves the door open to further investigate new applications where PINNs and GANs can be combined to amplify their strengths and reduce their weak points. One of those applications regards the forecast of severe weather conditions, where PINNs are useful to compute the fluidic behavior of storms approaching a certain location, whereas GANs can incorporate many additional parameters, such as wind speed, humidity, temperature and electric content, which may be essential to determine if in the following 48h a certain location is going to suffer from severe weather conditions. The estimation and forecast of storms is essential to the air transport industry, since the losses incurred due to delays and deviations of air traffic caused by the presence of storms have been reported to be over $38.5 billion in USA. The development of a computational architecture which is able to determine if severe weather events are going to take place within the next 48h is therefore of crucial importance. There exists no model nor application in which the combined strengths of PINNs and GANs have been put into practice, one to rapidly estimate the fluidic behaviour of a moving storm, the second to calculate the properties of the field with high precision.","The novel development of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which incorporate the constraints given by physics laws into the training process, as excellent means of computing fluidic fields and their characteristics such as velocity and pressure has open the gates to numerous applications.
