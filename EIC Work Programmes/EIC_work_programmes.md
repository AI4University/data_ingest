# EIC Work Programmes Ingest
Jupyter Notebook for the dataset creation for the EIC Work Programmes

**Two Options of Use:**
* Enabling the loop:
  - If we set LOOP=True, we will be creating a unique dataset for all the different work programmes (Pathfinder, transition,...).
* Disabling the loop:
  - In case we just want to obtain a unique database for an specific work programme, we can set LOOP=False and set programme equal to the work programme we are interested in.

Before executing, we must specify the path where all the pdf documents are located.
